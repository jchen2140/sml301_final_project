The muffin was essentially a chocolate chip muffin. This was the best muffin I've ever had in my life. Now granted, I haven't had muffins in two months, and I LOVE muffins, but having this gluten free option is like a sign from above that God cares about us gluten intolerant folks, too.

I'm usually a Monday or Thursday night kinda guy, preferring more new wave/indie/pop music than some of the harder gothic/industrial music they play on other nights. For those who are somehow still into cobwebs and corsets and fake fangs, there's a plethora of nights for you. Some of my best memories are dancing hard with a hundred strangers surrounding me, puddles of sweat under our feet, and massive cheers in the wee hours of the morning when the lights flick on and they kick everyone out.

Some of the staff/bartenders/dancers seem to take themselves too seriously, preventing this place from the five stars it probably deserves, but that's hit or miss because I've met some fabulous people working at the Castle over the years.

Time keeps marching on, but inside the Castle there's a strange phantasmagorical atmosphere of old punks and goths, 90s subcultures, hipsters, sexual deviants, local celebrities (The Senator and Peter Pan!) and everything in between, marching to the beat of their own drums.

About the coolest little eating place/drinking spot around. There it is, all funky-vibed in the middle of Swedesboro. Well then! Cool ceiling fixtures, weird art, crazy chotzkas, dim lighting. (Certain I spelled ""chotzkas"" wrong. Shrug. I'm tipsy.)  You have me titillated. Enthralled. Intrigued. Enraptured. Tipsy. Did I mention tipsy?  Visually fantastic. Super chill.

Draft list? Solid. Lots of local flavors and craft favorites.  We sat at the bar and perused the sweet taps.  Pretty excellent for small town nj. Pretty excellent for old city, philly, too, if you want to compare apples to nowhere-to-park-Philadelphia grapefruit.

Food? Ooookay. Nothing super spectacular, at least from what we sampled. Flatbread pizza? Decent, definitely. Gravy fries? Yum! Nice job. The Pittsburghian Capn was diggin it lots. 

Service? Fab! Happy, attentive waitstaff. 

Overall? Yay! A new happy place. Especially on a Tuesday. Did I mention I'm  tipsy? Will definitely be back. Side note: since the grand move, I live, like, six blocks from here. Perfect walking distance.

My girlfriend and I both ordered veal - she ordered veal parmigiana and I ordered veal Marsala. Both veal cutlets came out pretty small and dry looking.

UzU1N9XSoAUwn4Z8BIcvKw,4.0,"I'm not a fish guy.  Childhood in a fishing village on an island in Puget Sound means I can tell quality, but that I'm generally sick of it.  My girlfriend's father, however, is a don't-take-""no""-for-an-answer type of guy, so we were going to Anastasi for a holiday family celebration.

The whole party was about as disruptive as a four-person table can be in the center of the small dining room, which is bordered by the frozen counters of an indoor fish market (being in the evenings sealed tightly enough that the fishy smell is tolerable and the room keeps warm). The staff up to the owners themselves humored us and attended everything pleasantly and speedily.  The waiter was, not to his great discredit but certainly not toward helping the rowdiness of the situation, a bit of a chummy guy.

The food was so perfectly what it was advertised as and what it should have been, being smack in the middle of the Italian Market, that I'd like to call it ""the comfort food of gourmet.""  I got muscles in white wine sauce over noodles I can't remember how to spell, someone ordered a fish entree which looked great, and two incredibly-cheap lobsters were devoured by the others.  I can't promise they always have cheap lobster, but they do seem like they'd probably always have a randomly seasonally cheap offering of some sort.

The wine was just fine, but I was ordering on my girlfriend's father's credit card, so I didn't try any of their nicer bottles.

Don't come here for food tourism: go get a cheesesteak or something; come here in the day to get authentically good fish and in the evening to eat only if it's an occasion.

Seeing what people wore back in the day isn't really Jew-specific.  At least a lot of the clothes on display didn't seem to be Jew specific.

I also thought it was so lame that they only take credit cards (and run them after sunset) on Saturdays.

_V3YkIkqAn4V6U-cAykVtw,2.0,"Food was okay, nothing to come back for honestly. The service wasn't great and is the main reason for the low rating. It was slow and not thorough at all. Between taking our order and bringing out our food, it took over half an hour before the first item was delivered to the table. The crab cakes were mostly batter, which was disappointing. Two of our orders were forgotten, and when we asked our server about it, they had no idea what happened to it and we ended up canceling one of them because it would have taken way too long to wait on that. Was super excited to try this place out based on reviews but ended up cutting our losses. :(",food was okay nothing to come back for honestly the service wasnt great and is the main reason for the low rating it was slow and not thorough at all between taking our order and bringing out our food it took over half an hour before the first item was delivered to the table the crab cakes were mostly batter which was disappointing two of our orders were forgotten and when we asked our server about it they had no idea what happened to it and we ended up canceling one of them because it would have taken way too long to wait on that was super excited to try this place out based on reviews but ended up cutting our losses

NCKTDyUdN2UkVEPKWIwdSA,3.0,"This was my very first time at the AMC Painter's Crossing. I have been to the Movie Tavern in Collegeville, so I already had some pretty lofty expectations going in.  As soon as we walked in, I immediately was not impressed with the lobby area. It was pretty small, and I could see this area getting easily congested on a Friday/Saturday night. Fortunately we went at 5pm on a Wednesday, so it wasn't too bad. 

The theater itself is very nice. The leather seats were comfortable enough that allowed for a pleasurable movie experience. The main thing with me was the overpriced food. The quality of the food is pretty bad (think Applebee's). $16 for a chicken tender plater entree that was mediocre at best is completely ridiculous. The alcoholic beverages were actually more reasonably priced than the Applebee's quality food. We don't mind spending money on good food, but the food served at this AMC left much to be desired. We should have went to the the Carrabba's across the way. I'm sure we would have spent less there on the (moderately better) food than we did at the movie theater.

The moral of this review is that unless you're absolutely starving, stick to just getting popcorn and a beverage (or an adult beverage). Take your appetite elsewhere unless you like overpaying for subpar food. We certainly would come back to this AMC, but the next time we'll stick with the usual popcorn and beverage combination. If you fancy eating decent food, the Movie Tavern has a pretty significant edge on AMC, even though the food prices are pretty similar.",this was my very first time at the amc painters crossing i have been to the movie tavern in collegeville so i already had some pretty lofty expectations going in as soon as we walked in i immediately was not impressed with the lobby area it was pretty small and i could see this area getting easily congested on a fridaysaturday night fortunately we went at pm on a wednesday so it wasnt too bad the theater itself is very nice the leather seats were comfortable enough that allowed for a pleasurable movie experience the main thing with me was the overpriced food the quality of the food is pretty bad think applebees for a chicken tender plater entree that was mediocre at best is completely ridiculous the alcoholic beverages were actually more reasonably priced than the applebees quality food we dont mind spending money on good food but the food served at this amc left much to be desired we should have went to the the carrabbas across the way im sure we would have spent less there on the moderately better food than we did at the movie theater the moral of this review is that unless youre absolutely starving stick to just getting popcorn and a beverage or an adult beverage take your appetite elsewhere unless you like overpaying for subpar food we certainly would come back to this amc but the next time well stick with the usual popcorn and beverage combination if you fancy eating decent food the movie tavern has a pretty significant edge on amc even though the food prices are pretty similar

PLKpDCd-wT6ha6VQmU5QGw,5.0,"The measure of a great roof job is not just in the ease of the transaction, about which i can say that Justin is quick to respond to a phone call, professional and thorough in his trade, but does the freshly applied roof actually stop the leaks that have been plaguing you for months?

My roof is just shy of being a full fledged ""crispy critter"", but Justin informed me that we can extend the life for another 8 or so years with his coating.

My roof was re-coated last week.  It took Justin and his worker one full day (spread over two mornings) to complete my roof.  They were on time both days, communicated clearly what they were doing and when.  Then they just did their job, without leaving any kind of a mess behind.

THE TEST:  11/3/2016 - Eastside of Tucson gets a real gully washer of a storm that comes through about 7:30ish at night.  As the thunder rolled and the lightning sizzled through the air, my wife and I started dashing about the house, checking all the spots that leaked prior to the new roof going on...NOTHING WAS LEAKING!  The rain came down in sheets, in several coursed over the next hour or so and not so much as a drop inside.

If I could give you 10 stars I would.",the measure of a great roof job is not just in the ease of the transaction about which i can say that justin is quick to respond to a phone call professional and thorough in his trade but does the freshly applied roof actually stop the leaks that have been plaguing you for months my roof is just shy of being a full fledged crispy critter but justin informed me that we can extend the life for another or so years with his coating my roof was recoated last week it took justin and his worker one full day spread over two mornings to complete my roof they were on time both days communicated clearly what they were doing and when then they just did their job without leaving any kind of a mess behind the test eastside of tucson gets a real gully washer of a storm that comes through about ish at night as the thunder rolled and the lightning sizzled through the air my wife and i started dashing about the house checking all the spots that leaked prior to the new roof going onnothing was leaking the rain came down in sheets in several coursed over the next hour or so and not so much as a drop inside if i could give you stars i would

85HTEU6hNsdK4gv1A4Cfww,4.0,"When I heard that Sprouts was coming to town my first thought was ""Another grocery store??"" But now that I've been there several times I'm really glad they are an option available to us now. They have a wide variety of interesting products and their prices are quite reasonable. Using coupons is something I should do but most the time do not bother with. Their app makes it so easy that even I don't mind it. You can just select the deals you want in the app and when you check out you scan a code from the app and it takes care of everything. They'll also just give away stuff from the app. I got a 16 oz bottle of coconut water for free! Their prepared foods they make are actually my favorite of any grocery store chain. They're not frozen, but rather refrigerated items that you can just throw in the microwave. The stuffed shells are especially good. One complaint that I have is that the bakery section is so boring. After seeing the beautiful cakes, pastries, tarts, etc in the display cases at Publix or Whole Foods it's kind of a let down. I also wish that we could buy smaller portions of desserts because I don't need that temptation around me.

fWOCXPbyxH7mbhxNuosEeA,1.0,"First, there were sequin purses with Hello Kitty or something on them that they probably bought on Canal St. and marked up 10,000%. Why, I do not know. 

There are about 9 colleges within 5 miles of this location yet they waste their time on 12-year-olds. Anyway, without realizing what this place was, I went to this location to sell some items (everywhere from Burberry to Gap) and the franchise manager woman I encountered here was atrocious.  She was a mid-life crisis Housewife-wannabe mess! She was dressed younger than she could pull off with her visible wrinkles, bad-dye-job hair, and Theresa Guidice make-up.  She went through about $4000 in clothes I had, and passed on everything but like 2 items.  I was really stunned because I saw Target-type crap on the racks closest to me as I waited, and yet she passed on worn-once or new with tags stuff from BCBG, Bebe, Patagonia, Banana Rep, Ann Taylor 100% cashmere, and some couture names from Neimans.

First, as many have mentioned, it is totally tween-city here; so trendy it was laughable. The better fashion mags teach you to keep in style, but not be a trendy clown, yet it appears that this Plato's is preying on local youth whose bourgeois parents don't know how to guide them into upscale taste.  This Plato's was like a store for lame fashion mags who teach awkward teens how to mimic the look they are being paid to sell by trashy mall stores. The people who actually do that are those who don't understand that replicating a magazine outfit is like copying a catalog to furnish your home. 

Anyway, the tanned nightmare woman basically shamed me for not bringing her trendy low-quality crap, and then offered an insulting price on the two items she did want ($4 total).  So I gave her the look she had earned, gathered my things, and left.  I will not be back ever.  I don't buy trendy clothes, and when I have kids that age they will not be buying trendy clothes either.  I also don't patronize shops run by wrinkled barbies who mentally never left high school. Try an attitude improvement and some gratitude when you've just wasted an hour of someone's time.

    Verizon Tech support. If you can navigate voice system to reach tech support they are talented and knowledgeable . The picture also is very good

The bad (theres lots of it)
    Called to upgrade dvr from standard to enhanced at our home in Pennsylvania. Took over 13 phone calls to achieve this. 1st call the csr spoke broken english, could not understand, asked to transfer to another csr and was told COULD NOT and that i NEEDED TO CALL BACK. Encouraging that a communication company cannot transfer a call. 

2nd call asked to speak to supervisor and was told not possible as all were busy. Offered to wait but was told not a option. 

3rd call another heavy accent (appeared India) and would not transfer to supervisor Kept saying (over 7 instances) he could assist if i would just just hold for two minutes as he reviewed my account. Ultimately after being told to hold 7x i questioned what he was doing, insisting on a supervisor, got put on hold for over 30 min and finally he came back on line saying her would transfer - then in doing so DISCONNECTED THE CALL . Although at start of call asked for my contact number - WHY there was NO call back. 

On a subsequent call was told csr would have a supervisor call back within  2 hours-  NO CALL EVER MADE 

Finally a csr took the order (changes) and emailed me a copy. Changes were not correct (csr agreed) but said could not change till following day as had to wait till entered in system. Advised would make changes next morning and call me to confirm. NEVER HAPPENED. 

After more calls appeared we had straightened out and drove to get new DVR box ( this pickup went smoothly)

Upon connecting the box (not hard) it would not register. Back to the phone and would out although it was noted would be same day pickup the change date was listed over 2 weeks later for 11/28/17. This again took multiple calls  to identify and resolve. Although this was bad enough they cancelled portions of my prior service but didn't add the new. Just like dealing with the KEYSTONE COPS. 

Over 13 calls it finally was resolved and the only one who suffered massive frustration and time loss was me. Of course nothing from Verizon- not even a free movie.

Verizon touts their customer service however my experience was incompetent and horrific service excluding tech support. Embarrassment for a major company in the communications industry

Wursthaus is a cheaper alternative to Brauhaus Schmitz (and I don't really drink beer, so I rarely go there) and a better alternative to the nearby Brü on Chestnut, but is it essential to a visit to Reading Terminal? No, they're probably not even on the radar of the New Yorkers who come to tell us how much better their food is, like DiNic's and the Amish. 

I come here when I get tired of Dinic's after having it every week for a month, or when I crave some good old German food. 

The specialty sandwiches are HUGE for just $8, like a foot long! You don't even need a side, which I'm dying to try since the sides at Brauhaus are amazing, but the sandwiches are so large, you don't even need them! The Bavarian (smoked sausage, Bavarian coleslaw, fried onions, and horseradish sauce) is a great choice, but I found myself disappointed in the amount of meat on the Leberkäse sandwich (German onion meatloaf, grilled onions, and spicy horseradish mustard).

H3WJK0fpoPrIotWqOG_yIA,5.0,"I can't believe it has taken me this long to write a review for Bru Burger Carmel, considering how many times I have ordered it. Too many good things to say about this place. I've been a loyal customer since before their Carmel location, and would venture downtown to the Mass Ave location for their delicious burgers. So happy this closer location opened up. I would previously only order the BBQ Mexicali Burger, because I figured, how can you possibly get better than that. Then, on a whim, I tried the Salmon Sandwich. I never would normally put salmon but this is so so yummy. After realizing their menu was probably stacked equally delicious items, I then tried the taco salad. For it being a burger place, this is now my favorite salad ever. I also can't leave out their fries with the housemade ketchup. To round it all out, the white chocolate peach bread pudding is definitely a top 3 restaurant dessert. Also, their carry out process is very easy. In summation, CANNOT GO WRONG.",i cant believe it has taken me this long to write a review for bru burger carmel considering how many times i have ordered it too many good things to say about this place ive been a loyal customer since before their carmel location and would venture downtown to the mass ave location for their delicious burgers so happy this closer location opened up i would previously only order the bbq mexicali burger because i figured how can you possibly get better than that then on a whim i tried the salmon sandwich i never would normally put salmon but this is so so yummy after realizing their menu was probably stacked equally delicious items i then tried the taco salad for it being a burger place this is now my favorite salad ever i also cant leave out their fries with the housemade ketchup to round it all out the white chocolate peach bread pudding is definitely a top restaurant dessert also their carry out process is very easy in summation cannot go wrong

Tonight was different from the normal service I receive. The wait was an hour long. We decided to go ahead and wait ofcourse. We stepped outside to grab a couple drinks at the outside bar. Two girls were tending bar this evening. The bar wasn't busy. While waiting, no one acknowledged us.  I thought maybe they had things they were rushing to before getting to us. I continued to wait. I noticed the blonde continued to wash glasses. A gentleman from the bar asked for a drink and she rushed over to him. Once she got closer I asked if I could order a couple drinks and she informed me bar guests were first to be served and she would get to me. What was I waiting for exactly? I replied okay and continued to wait. The second bartender came around and never made eye contact with me. A guest was telling her a story so I waited until she came closer and asked if I could just order 2 beers. The blonde quickly came over to inform me they were following policy and that if I wanted to speak to a manager about it she'd grab him. How do you have time to find a manager to tell me you can't serve me yet you can't pour 2 drinks? I was there for quite some time waiting and consider myself to be more patient than most. I told her I wasn't interested in speaking with management and that I simply just wanted 2 drinks. At this moment I asked myself why this bartender was even working. I was never rude yet received rude service. I was also confronted with ""if you have a problem with it let me grab my manager"". I was there observing everything going on around me. It was obvious this employee was disgruntled. Thank you to the other bartender for making the beers which I was more than willing to pay for. She didn't charge me which didn't fix the issue.

And while ribs are more important than everything else, the everything else that you can find here at the Farmers Market makes me reconsider [but not retract] that statement.

Before we get into all that, you should know that there's a definite New Orleans vibe happening here (and all over St. Louis); maybe it migrated up the Mississippi...all I know is that you can get a legit bloody mary from Julia's for only $4 (and beignets if you'd like). It's got pickled asparagus and a spicy bean, and sipping on that thing as you peruse the rest of the market is the move.

What else can you peruse? 

Pimped out pickles. Pecan pie in a jar. Any kind of meat you'd ever want, including pig ears. Fruit Loops kettlecorn. NFL jerseys, mugs, t-shirts, hats, etc. Goose Poop. Seafood. Every kind of fresh produce you can think of. Pork rinds. Mini-doughnuts. Spices. Flowers. Roasted nuts. SO MUCH SOAP. Pastries, oils, salsas...I can't even remember it all.

Wanted a nice meal. End of a big day at work. 

Carbonara: Too much pancetta (I know! but still!), noodles were over-cooked and soft, and some idiot decided to cut the spaghetti so you could eat it like a 5 year old. Blech. What a bummer. I love a good carbonara and this was just not that. Plus the serving was the size of a football. Gross.

Ordered a side of veggies to even out my luxe entree. Server suggested the cauliflower. I said, Is it fried? He said, ""uhh pan fried."" It came breaded and deep fried. Then laughed, ""oh well.""

I ordered the Fish Tacos but before that came I had the Fowl Play flat bread, which was amazingly delicious concoction of BBQ sauce, chicken, cheese and chives.

When I finally had a chance to dive into the Fish Tacos that I ordered they were exquisite beyond imagination, soft juicy fish, crunchy coleslaw, with a drizzle of flavored tar tar sauce.  The side to accompany these delicious deep sea treats was kettle chips drizzled with sour cream and chives that were crunchy and bursting with flavor that I really enjoyed.

My wife could not pass up the chance to try the chicken and cheddar waffles.  She loved them!  she barely let me try a bite she loved them s much, I had to beg!  and they were awesome!  cheddar waffles mixed will with the friend chicken after being drenched in jalapeno maple syrup.  Seriously, try them, they are so delicious!

to top it all off,  we shared a caramel apple gelato which was pretty good, not as good as Paciguo but when you check into Datz with your mobile phone you get a free gelato so I enjoyed sweet deliciousness knowing it was free.

6_T2xzR74JqGCTPefAD8Tw,5.0,"For a special occasion, I highly recommend going with the omakase - the chef's tasting menu. Currently, there is a $120 and a $150 option. 

I usually get slightly anxious when I don't get to select my own food, but turns out anxiety is completely unwarranted at Morimoto. Every single course (of 8) was fantastic! There were many delicious items that were not on the regular menu, whether raw or cooked. We felt the $120 omakase was worth every dollar. 

Besides the ridiculously awesome tasting menus, Morimoto also has an a la carte menu, complemented by a beverage list consisting of signature cocktails, interesting Japanese beers, and various types of wine - though they also have a full bar available. While eating here is not cheap, Morimoto's a la carte prices are no greater than typical fine dining prices in Philly. 

Most recently, I had their duck duck duck dish, which consisted of the most tender and flavorful duck breast with the most amazing sauce, served with a side of duck confit fried rice, topped with a duck egg. The portioning was great: filling, but not overwhelming. It complemented well with my golden pear martini, which is very fruity and delicious. 

The tuna pizza appetizer was also a wonderful mixture of flavors and textures. It tasted so light and fresh. For dessert, I was torn between the black sesame mousse cake and the matcha tres leches. I ended up picking the matcha tres leches. It was very tasty, but once I left the restaurant, I began developing a strong craving for the black sesame mousse cake. 

Darn, I should have ordered both desserts.

8NyDM-FDoWEEeEG9XUwnbg,4.0,"We made the major, catastrophic mistake of eating at Willie Mae's the same day that we had dinner reservations at K-Pauls.  Do not make this same mistake.  If you have dinner at K-Paul's, eat light the rest of the day so that you do not ruin this wonderful experience.  And don't think that enough time between meals will suffice... we showed up at Willie Mae's around noon, were done eating by 3 pm, and were still stuffed when it came time for our 9:45 pm dinner reservation at K-Paul's.  But the troopers that we are, we showed up on time for our reservation and managed to eat an entire meal.  I tell this story to make the point that even stuffed, the food at K-Paul's was outstanding.

The mini corn bread muffins that they start with at the table were so good that we each managed to eat more than one, knowing that it was a bad idea to further ruin our appetites.  Then came the real food.

Appetizers:
Cajun Jambalaya (The Most Famous Rice Dish in Louisiana Cooking. We Start With Onions, Bell Peppers, Celery, Tasso, Sausage, Chicken, Tomatoes, Jalapenos and Garlic, Combined with a Rich Stock and Simmered for Hours with Just the Right Amount of Rice Folded in and Served with Sauce Piquant)

We ordered this to the table to share, and it was some of the best jambalaya that I've ever had. It comes in both an appetizer and entree size, and had I not been so full, I might have considered the entree size.

Entree:
Roasted Pear, Pecan, and Bleu Cheese Salad
Sliced, Roasted Fresh Pears with Fresh Roasted Pecans and Crumbled Bleu Cheese, Served on a Bed of Mixed Greens with a White Balsamic, Honey-Lime Vinaigrette Dressing (+Chicken)

I had to throw in the towel on getting a full entree and get a salad.  It was good, not great, but that's what I get for ordering a salad at K-Paul's.

I did have a bite of the Blackened Louisiana Drum that my friend ordered and can declare that it was quite delicious.  

** SPOILER ALERT **

I also have to take a moment to talk out our waitress, Sheila.  Sheila has a ""classic"" move that I guarantee you have never before experienced at a restaurant.  If you want to be surprised, stop reading. Otherwise, continue...

Sheila came over to the table, picked up my friend's fork and knife, and starting cutting up his steak.  For a second I thought she was helping him cut his meat, then I thought she was going to take a bite of it.. but no, so took that cut of meat, walked around the table, and fed it to my other friend.  She continued to do this until each of us had had a bite of each other's food.  It is unlike anything I've ever experienced in a restaurant and was quite honestly, amazing.

** END SPOILER **

All in all, despite being full when I showed up, this was a great experience.  Sheila kept us entertained throughout our meal and was very understanding of our ""situation"". She even gave us some of the [very unique] paper used to line the bread basked to take home with us.

Downfalls - customer service and lack of security! My last trip in May resulted of a $1500 jackpot... YAY! And my car being stolen in their parking lot... BOO! 

When we hit the jackpot it took me going to the casino host station with 4 standing around talking to get someone to assist us in our hand pay and when I asked the gentleman was rude and stormed off to find the machine and my boyfriend on his own. Sad that a happy moment had to be ruined with someone's poor attitude. But we let that go and went on with the night. The next morning was our checkout day. Had everything packed and dog in tow and headed to the front desk to return our room keys. Walk out to the parking lot to where we though we parked the car and it was gone. Hit the panic button on the alarm and it wouldn't register. The key fob kept telling us it wasn't picking up a signal. Boyfriend ran over the hill to check the other parking lot and same thing. My heart sank! This couldn't be happening! We went in to the front desk spoke to security who asked if we were sure we parked there (I get it people get drunk and stupid and lose cars, not the case) we said no we remembered where we parked and we were sure this wasn't a bad joke that a friend had pulled. They said a guard would meet us out front. The guard who met us out front showed up in a van and explained that the resort may have relocated the car to a different area of the parking lot... UMMM WHAT?! So here we are bags and dog in two and he says he'll drive us around the parking lots. And just sits in the van. Boyfriend asks of we could put our bags in he says sure and doesn't even offer to help or open the trunk so we can throw our bags in there. So I decide to stay back with bags and dog. *Plus side - a very nice bell desk clerk offered to help me bring bags and dog back to the curb so I could wait when he overheard the car was stolen.* After they got back from driving around the entire parking lot we were escorted to the security office and they once again asked of we were sure that we came back Friday night and if that's where we really parked. Yes we were sure again! They fed us some crazy line that the police wouldn't come to us and we would have to find our way to them. Didn't offer us a place to sit no water nothing. I finally decided to take matters into my own hands and called Reno PD non emergency number because really the car is gone and who knows when it went missing between Friday night and Sunday morning! They explained they would definitely be sending an officer out and that the casino had given us the wrong info for how to file a report. About 3 hours after checking out we had finally gotten somewhere and it was no thanks to GSR. Security was not empathetic or really even friendly and after being asked multiple times if we were sure we didn't lose the car I felt judged and labeled. Not once did a head of security speak with us and the hotel manager or some type of manager never made an appearance, call or email. 

I used to love going here, but after they handled this I just don't feel safe or secure on their property. I can't trust that I or my family and belongings will be safe. It's an unfortunate incident. Even after trying to reach out to GSR ourselves we had no luck in hearing from anyone of importance. I waited as long as I could to write a bad review because I wanted to give them a chance to respond to emails, calls and feedback from the surveys they've sent me and I've heard nothing.

Acme House did not disappoint.  My wife and I went there twice during the week stay. Both times we got lucky and were seated right away. I've read reviews about the line going around the corner and was thrilled we didn't have to wait in the heat. 
The staff was extremely nice and helpful with their welcoming suggestions. We started off with a dozen raw oysters and a dozen char grilled oysters. Hands down, the best I've ever had. 

Another great thing about this restaurant is the draft beer selection. I really enjoyed getting acquainted with the local beer, Abita. Some were better than others, but that's generally the case for most breweries. My favorite is the Andy Gator. I only came across a couple of places that served this beer and was thrilled to find out they even had it on tap!

gzMlFR9ViVCr_HUYPgqqVg,4.0,"I saw a picture of a burger from this place that looked so delicious that I felt that this place was basically daring me to come in and try. This place is a little expensive and looks very nice. We walked in and got a table right away. I have an affinity for sweet girly drinks, in particular mimosas. I had seen some women drinking some on a balcony before I came in so I was really craving one. The waitress said it was no problem and brought back a very tasty one. I ordered the burger and unfortunately they were out of fries. They offered to substitute something else but I really wasn't in the mood so just ordered the burger. I figured this way it would have to stand on its own and I would see if it measured up. It really did not disappoint. You can really taste it when you eat a quality burger, one that crumbles in your mouth when you take a bite and this was such a burger.

cgPke0UtMkQECm07ZRWHDA,4.0,"A high 4 out 5

First time coming to this place and i did not know what to expect. But my tastebuds and mind was blown when i entered here for a late night snack.  They have a variety of drinks from milk tea, bubble tea and fresh smoothies and all. 
The price is a dollar more than other places such as dream tea. But it is completely worth it in all aspects.
We had ordered 2 bubble teas, hot pudding milk tea, along with bubble waffle, ice cream wagurt, takoyaki, yam fries and their taiwanese style popcorn chicken.

The bubble tea has a half sweet, regular, extra sweet option, we went for the extra sweet and it was just perfect for me and my girlfriends tastebuds. We got the avocado+banana and just honeydew both with lychee jelly.

The hot pudding mango milk tea was also reallly really good. 

The Bubble waffle came out first and it was well decorated and presented well and their waffle was amazing! You have got to try it!

The icecream wagurt is basically bubble waffle but just all in a cup with more and more. It was too much for our taste buds tonight but it was still good.

And now the TAKOYAKI. I was never a fan of it until tonight!!  It is such of a better quality compared to other places we had been to. And i really enjoyed it. Had a nice light crisp on outside and the inside wasnt tooo too mushy it was just perfect and the flavor just stands out really well.  Goodjob purple bubble im officially a fan of takoyaki as of tonight i will be coming back for it!

Their yam fries were just different but original.  I enjoyed it well. They gave a good amount. 

Lastly, the Taiwanese style popcorn chicken was just right to end the night.  Gave a generous amount and u can tell it is better quality from the minute u see it.

I gave it a high 4 out of 5 because we came here during late at night and had really good quick easy prompt service,  i dont know how they are when its earlier in the day with students being on break or whenever its just a busier day or night.",a high out first time coming to this place and i did not know what to expect but my tastebuds and mind was blown when i entered here for a late night snack they have a variety of drinks from milk tea bubble tea and fresh smoothies and all the price is a dollar more than other places such as dream tea but it is completely worth it in all aspects we had ordered bubble teas hot pudding milk tea along with bubble waffle ice cream wagurt takoyaki yam fries and their taiwanese style popcorn chicken the bubble tea has a half sweet regular extra sweet option we went for the extra sweet and it was just perfect for me and my girlfriends tastebuds we got the avocadobanana and just honeydew both with lychee jelly the hot pudding mango milk tea was also reallly really good the bubble waffle came out first and it was well decorated and presented well and their waffle was amazing you have got to try it the icecream wagurt is basically bubble waffle but just all in a cup with more and more it was too much for our taste buds tonight but it was still good and now the takoyaki i was never a fan of it until tonight it is such of a better quality compared to other places we had been to and i really enjoyed it had a nice light crisp on outside and the inside wasnt tooo too mushy it was just perfect and the flavor just stands out really well goodjob purple bubble im officially a fan of takoyaki as of tonight i will be coming back for it their yam fries were just different but original i enjoyed it well they gave a good amount lastly the taiwanese style popcorn chicken was just right to end the night gave a generous amount and u can tell it is better quality from the minute u see it i gave it a high out of because we came here during late at night and had really good quick easy prompt service i dont know how they are when its earlier in the day with students being on break or whenever its just a busier day or night

It's small, dark interior is contrasted with the bustling atmosphere.  People of all kinds, from families with children to Vandy students to tourists and everyone in between, frequent this establishment and once you taste their cheeseburgers, you will know why.  

Their specialty is the Cheeseburger on French Bread which is filling at its moderatly priced five dollars.  Sides are all extra but worth it (I reccommend the onion rings).  They do not have a soda fountain so if you're a big soda drinker, watch out.  They serve small bottles at $1.85 a piece which can add up if you're thirsty.  

The restaurant is small, so a wait is sometimes necessary but the staff is friendly and the table turnaround time is quick.

ekYljPHt5KFDLHbBfpbRyQ,2.0,"I don't mind spending a premium on food but there's nothing here even worth charging a premium for.

I was excited for the store to open because it was in the neighborhood and was super excited to check it out. The first red flag was before I set foot in the store, the price of fire wood being double what it cost at the mobile gas station, Schnucks, and Dierbergs all by the way within a one mile radius.

I understand stores charging a premium for specialty or gourmet products but when Driscoll's brand raspberries, strawberries, blackberries and blueberries are all more than three times the price here than they are in the grocery store literally less than 500 ft. away it seems like the management team failed their year 1 basic economics class. Granted the bakery and meat department can have a façade of gourmet premium goods and charge a higher price here; it's way out of line to do so on known brands. At least peel the stickers off and slap something else on there.  I love the idea of their select your own candy but at lobster weight prices my sweet tooth can wait long enough to literally cross the street and spend ¼ the amount to get 5 times the quantity.  

I went in wanting to buy a premium, higher quality product, specifically asiago cheese and looked to find they only had one brand; ""Belgioioso"" brand cheese. Belgioso brand can be found at any of the several grocery stores within a  1/2 miles radius; which is exactly what I did as I went across the street and spent half the amount to obtain the same amount of cheese. 

The people who shop here are probably the ones who eat the Toblerone candy and raid the mini-bar in their hotel room after having lunch at the airport.  I'm not sure what the draw here is aside from the ambiance, hardwood floors and classical music but I'll save spending premium prices for actual premium goods.",i dont mind spending a premium on food but theres nothing here even worth charging a premium for i was excited for the store to open because it was in the neighborhood and was super excited to check it out the first red flag was before i set foot in the store the price of fire wood being double what it cost at the mobile gas station schnucks and dierbergs all by the way within a one mile radius i understand stores charging a premium for specialty or gourmet products but when driscolls brand raspberries strawberries blackberries and blueberries are all more than three times the price here than they are in the grocery store literally less than ft away it seems like the management team failed their year basic economics class granted the bakery and meat department can have a faade of gourmet premium goods and charge a higher price here its way out of line to do so on known brands at least peel the stickers off and slap something else on there i love the idea of their select your own candy but at lobster weight prices my sweet tooth can wait long enough to literally cross the street and spend the amount to get times the quantity i went in wanting to buy a premium higher quality product specifically asiago cheese and looked to find they only had one brand belgioioso brand cheese belgioso brand can be found at any of the several grocery stores within a miles radius which is exactly what i did as i went across the street and spent half the amount to obtain the same amount of cheese the people who shop here are probably the ones who eat the toblerone candy and raid the minibar in their hotel room after having lunch at the airport im not sure what the draw here is aside from the ambiance hardwood floors and classical music but ill save spending premium prices for actual premium goods

oBmkr9cUmwOBA4hLi3-U-w,5.0,"A Chinese restaurant that only uses half the space. I've only ever seen that closed half used for special occasions or party events. That half also has their only change table in the women's washroom, so you would need to inquire if you are dining in the main service area. That being said, there are 2 individual washrooms on each restaurant side, which are tight but functional...kinda of reminds me of a public transit washroom, nothing fancy & a little run down. High chairs & boosters are available, plus kid size cutlery if needed. 
Place looks a little dive, but food is where they shine... just don't order the ""western Chinese"" food and you'll probably have a better experience. The bilingual menu helps if you can't read characters (like myself). Servers also speak Chinese if you prefer- hubby & in-law spoke Cantonese to them. Servers are friendly, attentive, can better describe their dishes than the menu, comment about portion size & what's a better deal.  
There's better value to order a meal deal for multiples rather than solo dishes to share. Those meal choices come with a very simple beef broth soup with veggies (like carrots & lotus), and a dessert of sweet red bean soup with tapioca (I feel that one's an acquired taste). Those are typical accompaniments for most Chinese restaurants I've been to, flavour doesn't really vary between restaurants either. Service was impeccably fast, as food started popping up on our table within 5 minutes or ordering. 
Dishes we tried included: garlic soy chicken, chicken & pumpkin with coconut milk, sole fish & green beans, shrimp & peach yum yum, wonton noodle soup, and green onion cake. They were all pretty good and not spicy, but my fave was the sole fish with green beans (which were so tender crisp for a veggie). Portion amounts are nothing to complain about either as we end up with leftovers every time we go.",a chinese restaurant that only uses half the space ive only ever seen that closed half used for special occasions or party events that half also has their only change table in the womens washroom so you would need to inquire if you are dining in the main service area that being said there are individual washrooms on each restaurant side which are tight but functionalkinda of reminds me of a public transit washroom nothing fancy a little run down high chairs boosters are available plus kid size cutlery if needed place looks a little dive but food is where they shine just dont order the western chinese food and youll probably have a better experience the bilingual menu helps if you cant read characters like myself servers also speak chinese if you prefer hubby inlaw spoke cantonese to them servers are friendly attentive can better describe their dishes than the menu comment about portion size whats a better deal theres better value to order a meal deal for multiples rather than solo dishes to share those meal choices come with a very simple beef broth soup with veggies like carrots lotus and a dessert of sweet red bean soup with tapioca i feel that ones an acquired taste those are typical accompaniments for most chinese restaurants ive been to flavour doesnt really vary between restaurants either service was impeccably fast as food started popping up on our table within minutes or ordering dishes we tried included garlic soy chicken chicken pumpkin with coconut milk sole fish green beans shrimp peach yum yum wonton noodle soup and green onion cake they were all pretty good and not spicy but my fave was the sole fish with green beans which were so tender crisp for a veggie portion amounts are nothing to complain about either as we end up with leftovers every time we go

After we got our food and ate, guest what happened? After 30min we all run in the bathroom coz our stomach are all messed up! In my experienced the food here is not properly prepare and no proper handling. My advice to everyone please bring your own food just to make sure its clean and you don't have to wait for long time!

ytynqOUb3hjKeJfRj5Tshw,5.0,"Best Market in Town! Tons of places to explore and get local fresh produce, cheeses, meats, totally love the fresh sausage places.

Some places are expensive, so browse around and you can find good deals. The vendors are super friendly. Not the cleanest place in the common eating area, but it gets a ton of traffic. 

The Spices/Nut shop is the BOMB for loose by the pound spices. I will never pay full grovery store price for spices again. I got a HUGE handful of bay leaves for $1. Compare that to 10 leaves for $6.99 and it doesnt take a rocket scientist to figure out where to go in the future for spices! 

Must stops are the Beiber's donut place, and the Olive Oil/Balasmic Vinegar vendor. So many gems in there.

QK9s-Chx69_U-M2gsPb3Gw,2.0,"Another disappointment for the Bucks County restaurant scene. We live very close and decided to check it out. I hate going to places that just opened recently because I expect a thing or two to go wrong but I have to say there were many things displeasing. I really hate giving places a bad review but hopefully I can help the restaurant as well as future visitors. 
Again,I'm not a professional critic and not everything I am writing is a deal breaker, just figured I would take note to everything I think can be improved on.

Pros:   Nice atmosphere, bar area and outside patio are nice and the fireplace is a nice touch, bathrooms are nicely decorated and clean (but should be since its new), waitress was nice ...
I'm reaching here that is kind of where it ends.

Cons: I ordered the Clam chowder soup (my fav) and had to send it back because it tasted like someone accidentally knocked over a gallon of salt in it (and i love salt). * THEY WERE PROFESSIONAL IN THE SENSE THEY TOOK IT OFF THE CHECK.  My Compressed watermelon salad was pretty bland but that is probably because they forgot to put a main ingredient on it.  My husbands burger was good, not great, just good. The kids sliders were really good except there was caramelized onions on it. Most kids can be picky and we would have easily ordered it without onions if they had a physical kids menu so we knew what ingredients were on each entree. But they didn't so the waitress told us what they can make for kids.
      Service, though nice, was very slow and inattentive. Hardly ever saw her and we sat there waiting for long periods of time with nothing. 
Not sure if the kitchen does not like requests on what to NOT put in or on food but I overheard numerous tables around me complaining about that, where they asked to not put spices or pepper on something  yet it was on there and the waitress swears she told them herself to not put in on the entree (which I also read in other reviews as well apparently).
     We have 2 children ages 2 and 8. To help those with kids, the tables were a bit crammed together and the bathroom I was in did not have a changing table for those with young ones. There were 2 unisex bathrooms so maybe it was in the other one. They do have kids cups and high chairs, again great for young ones, but again if you have more then 3 people and a baby, the tight spaced dining areas leaves little room for anyone around you to move. Just didn't seem very kid friendly but they did have a good amount of options to order.
    Last, again because our waitress did not stop at the table often I had to go find someone to take our check and get change. We waited 15 min for the change till I had to take the bored kids out to the car while my husband waited another 10 min on top of that to get change. So 25 minutes waiting for a check to be taken care of. Someone other then our waitress then brings us change-a $50 bill. Number one rule in giving a customer change is to give small bills as well so they can tip you! Thank God I had just enough because we were not waiting even longer to get change to give a tip.
        Overall I would not recommend this place as of right now. Maybe if I wait awhile longer they will improve....Maybe. Would I give them a second chance sure, but not with kids and not anytime soon.

BHLryy0uhQ06Vx7Px5BvsQ,4.0,"I LOVE BHAN THAI. I ate lunch here multiple times. All of the dishes are flavorful and jam packed with different veggies and other ingredients. I really enjoyed the chicken curry puff appetizer. My favorite dish is the pad ce-ew. It is full of flavor and the sauce is evenly distributed throughout. The drunken noodles is not bad, but I definitely prefer the pad ce-ew. The eggplant basil is pretty good too!

My dad likes the spring rolls, but I don't think they're anything special (mostly just carrots and noodles inside). I would rather skip the appetizers and save room for the mango sticky rice as dessert. Not many Thai restaurants serve as big of a mango with the sticky rice anymore. And I love that they decorate the dish with strawberries too!

I'm taking 1 star off because unfortunately, I got an upset stomach the 2 times I ordered curry dishes. It might be the milk or powder they're using? From other reviews, it looks like I'm not the only one who got an upset stomach. Bhan Thai, please PLEASEEE look into this! I love Thai curry, and yours were delicious. I don't won't to risk my stomach for it though :(.

I think Mama has started to be slowly phased out of the kitchen.  The bulgogi has a little more fat on it than I remember, and the bi bim bap has less bulgogi in it.  However, the lunch special is unbeatable.  In addition to the entree you choose, they serve egg drop soup and Korean side dishes (kimchi, pickled radishes, cucumbers that look similar to kimchi, and something else).  It will definitely fill you up.

My favorites are the bi bim bap and the bulgogi.  Chop chae and kahlbi are also recommended.  I ALWAYS get the yukki mandu, which are deep fried dumplings, yum!

The aboreta I know best, including places like Longwood Gardens and the Morris Arboretum, are highly manicured and often just eye popping.  Tyler really isn't anything like that.

Further from the entrance, the paths are unpaved, the plants are unmarked, and the corny artwork is sparser.  These areas don't seem much like an arboretum, but more like slightly landscaped nature.

Pn6ruqQp6F00rVl36_I5pg,3.0,"I'm comparing this against other Walmarts, not more high-end grocery chains, and it comes out looking relatively good.

A couple years ago my husband and I went to this Walmart, experienced the clientele, and decided never to return. Even though I'm incredibly stingy, even I couldn't be tempted by their low prices to brave the people who would probably do quite well stirring up drama in a reality tv show. So what actually possessed us to return? I like to walk and since I am a crazy mosquito magnet, it has to be indoors. Every reasonable business was closed, so off to Walmart we went. (My husband maintains it is better just to walk me then have to deal with me at home when I need to move.)

Since we were there at 9 p.m. on a holiday, it was reasonably empty. If you take people out of the equation, this place isn't that bad. It literally has everything. I was doing some price comparison on vitamins and Walmart knocks everyone else out of the water! They have a liquor store (not connected, but it's only a couple feet away). They even had my husband's favorite movie theater snack - snowcaps. (I had to drag him away because they were only $.98).

In the back of the food section, there were a ton of carts with boxes on them. Great for playing hide and go seek, not wonderful for maintaining a clean look in a store. It didn't bother me too much, but you will definitely have to maneuver around some giant boxes. 

When this place is busy, it is definitely not worth the hassle. Yet I just learned that if you try to avoid the masses, this place isn't half that bad, which is why I'm giving it an A-OK.",im comparing this against other walmarts not more highend grocery chains and it comes out looking relatively good a couple years ago my husband and i went to this walmart experienced the clientele and decided never to return even though im incredibly stingy even i couldnt be tempted by their low prices to brave the people who would probably do quite well stirring up drama in a reality tv show so what actually possessed us to return i like to walk and since i am a crazy mosquito magnet it has to be indoors every reasonable business was closed so off to walmart we went my husband maintains it is better just to walk me then have to deal with me at home when i need to move since we were there at pm on a holiday it was reasonably empty if you take people out of the equation this place isnt that bad it literally has everything i was doing some price comparison on vitamins and walmart knocks everyone else out of the water they have a liquor store not connected but its only a couple feet away they even had my husbands favorite movie theater snack snowcaps i had to drag him away because they were only in the back of the food section there were a ton of carts with boxes on them great for playing hide and go seek not wonderful for maintaining a clean look in a store it didnt bother me too much but you will definitely have to maneuver around some giant boxes when this place is busy it is definitely not worth the hassle yet i just learned that if you try to avoid the masses this place isnt half that bad which is why im giving it an aok

One of the sirloin cuts had garlic butter or some sort of amazing garlicy thing and it was sooooo good! Definitely our favorite. I agree with the other reviews about the mushroom risotto- amaaaazing!

5Qe5XyVtWDhygiyRs-PmlA,2.0,"We went for the 5pm Christmas Eve dinner. This is the first year my family could all be together for the holiday and we decided to do something special...something that would make everyone want a tradition to follow...literally everything from the slow drink service, terrible food selection to the broken bathrooms was a total letdown.

It was completely underwhelming; hour long buffet lines, the price, the fact that some tables were served baskets of bread and others (like mine) just waited & starved. The stations were not even ready until 5:40. Then the wait staff called tables over two at a time. By 6:12 we still were not called up but  knew we had to leave soon as they had a second seating at 7 so we just got up and stood in the long line we assume we had been forgotten. The people who had gotten food and were seated had to contend with the insane lines of people constantly bumping into them as they sat with their family. Unfortunately by the time we finally got a plate to serve ourselves a lot of the food promised  was gone, picked over or nonexistent.

For $289 (4 adults/1 child) give me something to really boast about...make sure I eat in a timely manner..or at least be apologetic for the chaotic mess. The rumor floating around the restaurant was that the owners decided this year to cram more tables in then the past & eliminated the amount of space for the buffet so you had more people and less food.

Dipaolos catered our wedding & we were excited for Xmas Eve ...my husband literally left hungry as by the time we got to the meat carving station nobody was there to serve it and then when I went to get sweets for everyone the trays were bare.

UDD4X5TLUMARishbXUQA2w,4.0,"I go here before and after Flyers games and typically I stay at the bar area and frequently order from the bar menu but on occasions I will eat inside the restaurant. The biggest thing to keep in-mind is that this is in the Wells Fargo Center and all the prices in the arena are inflated. However it is very nice to have an option other than the typical stadium food. Right before the game (1hour before start) is the busiest time in the restaurant. Food will be delayed so if you don't plan on that, you will be disappointed. Either make reservations 1.5 hours before the game start or 15 minutes after game start and later for the less crowded times. If you want a table by the glass, make reservation a head of time. You can luck out on less popular games but on weekends and games with rival opponents to not be disappointed, make a reservation. I never had any problems with the food quality, cook, or temperature. The wait staff has always been friendly and attentive. If you are ordering at the bar, it will get crowded before and at each intermission. At these times it gets challenging to eat as you will be bumped as others are getting their drinks. However the bartenders are very experienced and courteous and make the situation enjoyable. My largest complaint is that the best menu items typically are the specials. A few weeks ago they had their version of a cheesesteak with Guinness braised onions and a cheese sauce that was very delicious but it was only for that game. That special also included a bottle of Guinness and a flyers book and hat all for $25.00. Again that was a special so it is hit or miss with the deals. But they do offer nightly deals there. It is an a-la-carte menu so if you are expecting complete dinner plates you will be disappointed. The Wells Fargo Center has great food throughout the stadium but if you want a fancier meal and do not mind the steep prices, then this will be an enjoyable option.",i go here before and after flyers games and typically i stay at the bar area and frequently order from the bar menu but on occasions i will eat inside the restaurant the biggest thing to keep inmind is that this is in the wells fargo center and all the prices in the arena are inflated however it is very nice to have an option other than the typical stadium food right before the game hour before start is the busiest time in the restaurant food will be delayed so if you dont plan on that you will be disappointed either make reservations hours before the game start or minutes after game start and later for the less crowded times if you want a table by the glass make reservation a head of time you can luck out on less popular games but on weekends and games with rival opponents to not be disappointed make a reservation i never had any problems with the food quality cook or temperature the wait staff has always been friendly and attentive if you are ordering at the bar it will get crowded before and at each intermission at these times it gets challenging to eat as you will be bumped as others are getting their drinks however the bartenders are very experienced and courteous and make the situation enjoyable my largest complaint is that the best menu items typically are the specials a few weeks ago they had their version of a cheesesteak with guinness braised onions and a cheese sauce that was very delicious but it was only for that game that special also included a bottle of guinness and a flyers book and hat all for again that was a special so it is hit or miss with the deals but they do offer nightly deals there it is an alacarte menu so if you are expecting complete dinner plates you will be disappointed the wells fargo center has great food throughout the stadium but if you want a fancier meal and do not mind the steep prices then this will be an enjoyable option

Mwc3n5Psw9wRaQ22vZWDYQ,4.0,"Great and interesting food with only okay beers, Bar Hygge is a welcomed addition to the Fairmount neighborhood. 

If you come to Bar Hygge, come early and with a good group of friends you can share with. This will maximize the amount of unique dishes you can sample. Arriving at 7pm on a Saturday night was probably a bad idea, but we managed to force our group of four in at the inviting bar while we waited for a table (we ended up with a coffee table in the side room, but beggars can't be choosers). While at the bar we tried some of the house made brews, and I wasn't too impressed, but as someone who is not a fan of Ales or IPAs, it's probably not to big of a surprise.

Where Bar Hygge really excels is in the food options. If you're looking for light fare, stick to the Hygge Boards, in which you can pick one, three or five items. My group ordered the Crispy Brussels, a soft cheese, and a duck pate. Being fatties, we also ordered a bunch of entrees too, starting with the crispy and delicious Hygge Frites with Kennebec Potato, sea salt & pepper, assorted dipping sauces. Next was the Waffle Wings, with Chili brined organic wings (a light and crispy breaded outside), waffle tempura, Pennsylvania maple, pickled watermelon (my favorite), and mild hot sauce. After that, we split the Grass-fed Beef Burger with Shelbourne 2 year cheddar, beer braised onions and fries. The burger is a slider and you only get one, but it's juicy and perfectly cooked. Next out was the Organic 'Cluck-Cluck' BBQ, Grilled and braised chicken, on top of cheesy grits-cakes, ancho and guajillo chili sauce, crispy hominy, jicama and kale salad, and avocado vinaigrette. I'm not sure what half of that stuff even is, but whatever it was is totally working in this dish, especially those cheesy fried grit cakes. Finally, we ended with the Fregola Mac n' Cheese, which consisted of broccoli and melted leeks, raclette fondue, roasted tomato gremolata. So a play on mac and cheese with stewed tomatoes, it had a strong broccoli taste I really enjoyed, and the fregola instead of pasta adds a new interesting texture.

5/1/2013

Stopped with 2 other guests to let them try out Lakeview's consistently good flavors.  Between 2 of us we had carnitas, lamb, chorizo, chicken and al pastor tacos, all excellent flavor and well seasoned.  Our third party had the egg and chorizo breakfast burrito with cheese, rice, and beans.  I had never had the burrito here so I made sure to have a taste and it was solid flavors as well.

Lakeview is still a favorite of mine whenever I'm in the area, and I'll continue to return.


11/1/2011

Nicolas, the chef at Lakeview Grill, serves up a winning combination of an extensive menu with great flavors, attentive and friendly service, a very pleasant environment and good prices.  For that, Lakeview Grill has earned it's place near the top of my Most Authentic Mexican Restaurants in Pinellas list:
http://www.yelp.com/list/most-authentic-mexican-restaurants-in-pinellas-clearwater

The restaurant is in a free-standing building fronted with glass that brightens the entire interior with sunlight.  The decor is simple, but the room is very neat and clean.  I'm guessing there are probably ~75 seats, including booths around the edge of the room, and tables in the center.

The extensive menu is on their website, so I won't exhaust the details.  Highlights are big variety of 8 specials and breakfasts, 10 soups, most all of the standard taqueria items, 10 dinners with all manner or meats, 6 seafood dishes, 7 sandwiches (including burgers), 6 salads, 7 appetizers, 5 desserts and a kids' menu.  There are even a few Greek dishes.

The menu includes a few unusual items not often seen in this area including tlacoyos, oval shaped  rolls made of masa (corn flour). They're like fresh corn tortillas, but are shaped like a torpedo and much thicker. The tlacoyos are then stuffed with ingredients/toppings.  Other unusual items are empanadas stuffed with either huitlacoche (aka corn smut, actually a fungus....""think mushrooms"" ....that grows on corn plants.  It's known by mushroom enthusiasts as ""porn on the cob""!)  or flor de calabaza (squash blossoms).

Soon after I sat down, a bowl of super thin & crisp tortilla chips with a red salsa (both extremely tasty) landed on the table, followed by a Modelo Especial brew.  I ordered up a plate of 3 tacos ($5.25).  The carnitas was very flavorful pulled pork, the chorizo had excellent spicy flavor, and the lamb was just incredible.  A few local Mexican restaurants offer lamb on the weekends, but Lakeview has it on the menu every day, and it's also available in their lamb stew.  The salsa verde available for the tacos was also delicious with a great combination of flavors and heat.

The service was excellent throughout the meal, with the friendly waitress stopping by many times to make sure I was satisfied or if I needed anything.  I was still eating when the restaurant emptied out, and Nicolas came out from the kitchen and introduced himself, and he also asked about the food and if I needed anything.  We then struck up a conversation about his food, as well as other Mexican food found in the local area.  He mentioned that his clientele is largely locals who have been longtime customers.  Given the great food and service, I can understand why folks come back often.  Although I live a good bit away, I know I'll do the same.   My scores on a Pinellas taqueria scale:

Atmosphere:  4
Service:  5
Food:  5
Value:  5

The food - mostly burnt chicken, way over salted fries, the burger would have been perfect if it had been served as described on menu with hickory smoked bbq sauce, which I never saw. The cheese stick appetizer was nasty with grease. My wife never received one of her sides and when she asked about it the second time the waitress said, ""Oh, we're out of that.""

XYwx1tsEB3_G0tgS6l-0PQ,2.0,"First of all, the historical building is just awesome and the ambiance perfect. There are several fireplaces, seats overlooking city hall, a separate bar and bistro seating... not a bad seat in the place. The blend of modern glass & marble w the historic wood & marble is fabulous.  We went here after our annual trip to the Christmas Village at City Hall, so convenient and near our parking garage. Now, some of the food was very tasty but some was not even as good as what I can make (and I'm no chef). I think the chef must have been off this night and left the recipe cards for the Sous Chef.  There was only 1 waiter on who was nice, but it took a reeeaaaly loooonnnng time to get a drink (which was yummy), then an extremely longer time for the food to start coming out, not even a piece of bread. The Cesar Salad was just like I could get at wawa, square store bought croutons, standard cheese, no distinctive quality for a $16 bowl of lettuce I expect better. Still not even a breadstick w the salad or anything to hold us over. Again another long wait until dinner came out, which was very tasty (my niece said chicken was awesome and my steak was cooked perfectly), the fries were just ok and the order of Brussel sprouts tasted as though they were boiled then tossed w some not so great thinned out sauce, not very tasty at all.  Took ANOTHER LOONNG time to get the check and by this time it was really late. We arrived by 8:15 and were leaving well after 11pm. No appetizer, just salad and meal. We didn't complain, the bus girl?manager kind of walked past us and asked ""everything ok"", I didn't want to fuss as I didn't want to make my niece uncomfortable. Had she come up to the table to ask, I may have asked about the delays or told her about the lackluster Brussel sprouts, but she was obviously not really interested in knowing. As an aside, it was NOT crowded by any means and they kept on moving around three ""reserved"" signs, as IF more people were coming, guess that makes u feel better about dropping $150 for poor staffing (slow service) & some low quality (some food was very poorly delivered).

O_wuhNjqLiWvRcYfbHw7Ag,3.0,"Read my full review before taking the 3 stars negatively....

This is your average little hole in the wall sushi place, and only one of the waitresses that has been there the 3 times I have been here speaks English it seems. This past time I tried to order from the other one because she seated us, and she nodded when I pointed to things, but when I asked her a question, she shook her head and walked away and the other one came over. Now that's not a bad thing, I applaud you for working in another country without your native language, but it might seem a bit daunting/difficult for first time visitors to Sushi Village.

It's set back off Severn and I only find it because I look for the cvs/Walgreens on the corner of the strip mall it's in (near taqueria corona if that helps)? 

Anyways, I had a Groupon so I went this past time and we just got a bunch of maki rolls because the all-you-can-eat sushi was not a part of that. They were decent. Tasted fresh, but they fell a part a bit because you could tell they were made in haste and the seaweed hadn't fully stuck together yet. In their defense they had ONE chef working for at least 30 people (most of whom ordered the AYCE which I will get to in a second). 

Side note: get the spicy seaweed salad, it's amazing. Seaweed salad, plus spicy mayo, crabstick, cucumber, and crunchy on top and it's only like $4.50.

The prices are AMAZING here like around $9-13 for elaborate rolls and like $4 average for the basic veggie, cali, philly, boston, eel type rolls. They even have a maki special for $12 that includes 3 basic rolls of your choice, miso, and house salad (WORTH IT)!!!

Anyways, I've had the AYCE sushi here before and I highly recommend it. Unlike the other buffets in the area, it's not food sitting out on the counter for hours and God knows how many people put their grubby hands and germs in it. They bring you a piece of paper and you check off the items on it that you want (both sushi/sashimi and kitchen items) and when you are done they bring you another piece of paper to check off more items... That way you order what you can eat AND it's freshly prepared (and you can taste the difference) and you don't have to worry about the germs.

So, despite the 3 stars, I still adore this place and it's one of my favorite sushi restaurants to go in the area, especially if I'm feeling the need for a sushi binge!",read my full review before taking the stars negatively this is your average little hole in the wall sushi place and only one of the waitresses that has been there the times i have been here speaks english it seems this past time i tried to order from the other one because she seated us and she nodded when i pointed to things but when i asked her a question she shook her head and walked away and the other one came over now thats not a bad thing i applaud you for working in another country without your native language but it might seem a bit dauntingdifficult for first time visitors to sushi village its set back off severn and i only find it because i look for the cvswalgreens on the corner of the strip mall its in near taqueria corona if that helps anyways i had a groupon so i went this past time and we just got a bunch of maki rolls because the allyoucaneat sushi was not a part of that they were decent tasted fresh but they fell a part a bit because you could tell they were made in haste and the seaweed hadnt fully stuck together yet in their defense they had one chef working for at least people most of whom ordered the ayce which i will get to in a second side note get the spicy seaweed salad its amazing seaweed salad plus spicy mayo crabstick cucumber and crunchy on top and its only like the prices are amazing here like around for elaborate rolls and like average for the basic veggie cali philly boston eel type rolls they even have a maki special for that includes basic rolls of your choice miso and house salad worth it anyways ive had the ayce sushi here before and i highly recommend it unlike the other buffets in the area its not food sitting out on the counter for hours and god knows how many people put their grubby hands and germs in it they bring you a piece of paper and you check off the items on it that you want both sushisashimi and kitchen items and when you are done they bring you another piece of paper to check off more items that way you order what you can eat and its freshly prepared and you can taste the difference and you dont have to worry about the germs so despite the stars i still adore this place and its one of my favorite sushi restaurants to go in the area especially if im feeling the need for a sushi binge

Where would I even begin. This is absolutely the worst experience I have ever had. Lied to about the NCPO checklist and was never given a copy with the purchase, vague answers, lied to about the length of the CPO warranty, and even when they tried to make things right it is half-a** with not even an ounce of care. I had to go the length of including Nissan Consumer Affairs through this whole deal so you would have thought they would have paid a little extra care or attention? Oh, heck no. It is obvious that they just don't care because there is no retribution for their actions. Each and every one of them needs to go to customer service training because they just don't have a clue what so ever. I am actually a salesman and CSR for my company so I know what it takes to do a proper job and yes, sometimes a customer can be unreasonable. All I was asking was that I got the car I paid for. It is so bad that I don't even want to take my 2011 Juke back there no matter what they promise me. They have had 3 chances over the past 2 1/2 months. If you want to see what might be the best documented run-around experience go to:
http://www.jukeforums.com/forum/nissan-juke-general-discussion/202410-dealership-run-around.html
I made sure to document the entire exchange from beginning to present with pictures and emails in chronological order of events. People need to be warned because I am not the only one that has gone through all of this with Conicelli and I don't want anyone else to suffer the consequences of buying from them. If this is how one of their dealerships is, then you have to question the entire family of dealerships because they are all named Conicelli.

CTZEnTsW2JYN2NH1BCAaZw,3.0,"We were in search of something, anything, that wasn't a chain restaurant that was near our hotel, & Yelp led us to Darfons. 

The service was great, very friendly & helpful. We got there during a half-price martini happy hour, so that in itself was a pleasant surprise. I had the Chicken Oscar, and it was OK... there wasn't a ton on the menu that caught my eye so I went with the chicken, which seemed frozen & a little reminiscent of Applebee's or a place like that. Definitely not a lot of options for vegetarians, and my friend ended up having to eat a hummus platter as her dinner.

This is definitely a better option that Shoney's or any of the other more chain-like restaurants near by, but if I lived in Nashville I wouldn't go out of my way to come back often. A little pricier than I thought it should be, but at least we got ourselves a happy hour deal on the drinks!",we were in search of something anything that wasnt a chain restaurant that was near our hotel yelp led us to darfons the service was great very friendly helpful we got there during a halfprice martini happy hour so that in itself was a pleasant surprise i had the chicken oscar and it was ok there wasnt a ton on the menu that caught my eye so i went with the chicken which seemed frozen a little reminiscent of applebees or a place like that definitely not a lot of options for vegetarians and my friend ended up having to eat a hummus platter as her dinner this is definitely a better option that shoneys or any of the other more chainlike restaurants near by but if i lived in nashville i wouldnt go out of my way to come back often a little pricier than i thought it should be but at least we got ourselves a happy hour deal on the drinks

They have a fantastic selection of non-alcoholic house made ciders, including an orange cream and pomegranate lime. And even better, they pour the NA ciders from a draft, AND have a canning machine so you can take your freshly poured drinks to-go! I appreciate they invested in something like that so people can support their business while still social distancing and just picking up things to-go. The owner was also very friendly and described all the drinks to me and offered samples, so you know that they are really passionate about their products.",im rating this as someone who doesnt drink alcohol but loves ciders they have a fantastic selection of nonalcoholic house made ciders including an orange cream and pomegranate lime and even better they pour the na ciders from a draft and have a canning machine so you can take your freshly poured drinks togo i appreciate they invested in something like that so people can support their business while still social distancing and just picking up things togo the owner was also very friendly and described all the drinks to me and offered samples so you know that they are really passionate about their products

For food we ordered the st Charles (eggs Benedict with the protein being fried chicken, can't go wrong!). I love hollandaise and I felt like there could have been more. The eggs were also a little overdone (not really runny) but the flavor was there!

We also had the bananas foster pain perdu which was very good. It comes pre dressed with syrup and could have used a little more (probably something we could have asked for more but it was pretty busy).

We had to try a side of the pig candy (basically caramelized bacon) which was pretty good but not mind-blowing like we were thinking it would be. 

Overall we loved our food and spent $52 for all of the above (including tax and tip).",this place is fun we sat at the bar and had coffee and a bloody mary to start the bloody mary was great and we felt it when we stood up for food we ordered the st charles eggs benedict with the protein being fried chicken cant go wrong i love hollandaise and i felt like there could have been more the eggs were also a little overdone not really runny but the flavor was there we also had the bananas foster pain perdu which was very good it comes pre dressed with syrup and could have used a little more probably something we could have asked for more but it was pretty busy we had to try a side of the pig candy basically caramelized bacon which was pretty good but not mindblowing like we were thinking it would be overall we loved our food and spent for all of the above including tax and tip
SB3C3rdvs9sRiULlpWCTMA,2.0,"The review I wish I had read before I went to get my hair done. I have recently relocated from out of state and was scared to death to find someone to do my hair. I had put it off for 2 months and could wait no longer. I've always loved and used Aveda hair products so my thought was I couldn't go wrong with an Aveda salon. I called to make my appointment and found whomever I spoke with at the desk to be a bit unfriendly and seemed to be in a bit of a hurry. I requested a brow and lip wax which never happened when I made my appointment, but I did not receive those services. The day before my appointment I was called and asked if I could move it back 15 minutes, which was fine but again the call felt rushed and unfriendly.
 I arrived at my appointment early as always and waited patiently. My appointment was at 1:15 and I had another appointment at 6:30 same evening. Which in my experience left me plenty of time to have my hair done and make it to my next appointment. I met my stylist, Sara, from the beginning I could tell she felt uncomfortable and overwhelms by my hair. Mind you my hair is a little thick but it straight and blonde, there is nothing too complicated about it. She proceeded to ask what I wanted to have done and I explained I needed to be brightened up. I explained that my previous stylist had always used foil highlights. I even showed her pictures of how I wanted my hair to look.  She kept asking me questions which made me more and more uncomfortable. I'm not a hairstylist I have no idea about the mechanism of coloring hair. She then went and got hair color swatches and started holding it up to my hair which made me even more uncomfortable. The next thing I know she goes over to a co-worker, who I believe is one of the owners and starts talking to her about what should do with my hair. Which I could plainly hear and freaked me out even more. At this point, I thought about leaving, but I  didn't want to be rude and I wanted to give her a chance. This all took about 20 mins, she then mixed her color and started foiling. 4 and a 1/2 hours later she was done foiling my hair, with some assistance from a colleague. I mentioned to her I needed to leave around 6 to make my 6:30 appointment which seemed to put her over the edge in terms of being stressed out.
 She washed me out and brought me back to my chair and I immediately knew my hair was going to be orange. Because of how long it took her to foil my hair there was no time for a cut, and she even had to ask a co-worker to help dry my hair. When they were done drying it, it was orange.  She kept mentioning to me that she knew I wasn't going to like it but since I had to leave that I would need to rebook an appointment to come back for her to fix it as well as cut it. It felt like somehow the fact it took her 4 1/2 hours to foil my hair was now my fault.
I should mention that when I checked it as a new client I was asked to complete a short form with information about myself, on that form it asked if I would like to be contacted after my appointment,  I indicated I would like to be contacted.  I was really hoping someone would reach out so I could explain my disappointment and see what we could do about fixing it without hurting anyone's feelings. It is now over a week later and I have yet to receive any form of communication.
I reached out to another local salon and explain to them what had happened with my hair. I could not have had a more different experience. The woman who answered the phone took time to talk to me about what happened, what I was looking to have fixed what level of experience stylist I want to be placed with. I was able to get in that day and have my hair fixed. I have found a new salon here in town that values me as a customer and was able to address all of my concerns within a 2 and a 1/2 hour window. They now have a customer for life.
 I really wish things had been different with pure concepts because I do love Aveda so much. But the lack of interests in booking my appointment, to realize I needed someone with a higher level of skill and confidence, as well as a stylist who did not know how to do my hair, set me and Sara up for an orange fail. I hope this experience has helped her become a better stylist.",the review i wish i had read before i went to get my hair done i have recently relocated from out of state and was scared to death to find someone to do my hair i had put it off for months and could wait no longer ive always loved and used aveda hair products so my thought was i couldnt go wrong with an aveda salon i called to make my appointment and found whomever i spoke with at the desk to be a bit unfriendly and seemed to be in a bit of a hurry i requested a brow and lip wax which never happened when i made my appointment but i did not receive those services the day before my appointment i was called and asked if i could move it back minutes which was fine but again the call felt rushed and unfriendly i arrived at my appointment early as always and waited patiently my appointment was at and i had another appointment at same evening which in my experience left me plenty of time to have my hair done and make it to my next appointment i met my stylist sara from the beginning i could tell she felt uncomfortable and overwhelms by my hair mind you my hair is a little thick but it straight and blonde there is nothing too complicated about it she proceeded to ask what i wanted to have done and i explained i needed to be brightened up i explained that my previous stylist had always used foil highlights i even showed her pictures of how i wanted my hair to look she kept asking me questions which made me more and more uncomfortable im not a hairstylist i have no idea about the mechanism of coloring hair she then went and got hair color swatches and started holding it up to my hair which made me even more uncomfortable the next thing i know she goes over to a coworker who i believe is one of the owners and starts talking to her about what should do with my hair which i could plainly hear and freaked me out even more at this point i thought about leaving but i didnt want to be rude and i wanted to give her a chance this all took about mins she then mixed her color and started foiling and a hours later she was done foiling my hair with some assistance from a colleague i mentioned to her i needed to leave around to make my appointment which seemed to put her over the edge in terms of being stressed out she washed me out and brought me back to my chair and i immediately knew my hair was going to be orange because of how long it took her to foil my hair there was no time for a cut and she even had to ask a coworker to help dry my hair when they were done drying it it was orange she kept mentioning to me that she knew i wasnt going to like it but since i had to leave that i would need to rebook an appointment to come back for her to fix it as well as cut it it felt like somehow the fact it took her hours to foil my hair was now my fault i should mention that when i checked it as a new client i was asked to complete a short form with information about myself on that form it asked if i would like to be contacted after my appointment i indicated i would like to be contacted i was really hoping someone would reach out so i could explain my disappointment and see what we could do about fixing it without hurting anyones feelings it is now over a week later and i have yet to receive any form of communication i reached out to another local salon and explain to them what had happened with my hair i could not have had a more different experience the woman who answered the phone took time to talk to me about what happened what i was looking to have fixed what level of experience stylist i want to be placed with i was able to get in that day and have my hair fixed i have found a new salon here in town that values me as a customer and was able to address all of my concerns within a and a hour window they now have a customer for life i really wish things had been different with pure concepts because i do love aveda so much but the lack of interests in booking my appointment to realize i needed someone with a higher level of skill and confidence as well as a stylist who did not know how to do my hair set me and sara up for an orange fail i hope this experience has helped her become a better stylist

My experience in particular was not great due to where they seated my wife and I. Apparently they thought it would be a good idea to have a booth right next to the host stand. Not only does it get loud and you're constantly interrupted by the hosts and other guests, but they also use the ledge connected to the booth as their workstation. This became a problem when the host dropped menus right into my wife's plate of food, gave a unapologetic sorry, and continued on working without making sure her food was contaminated from the dropped menu.

wImCKPqb1FvOIBPhXpUZTA,1.0,"This is a review for the VIP+18 Theatres

I'm a giant fan of going out to see movies on the big screen. I always love the experience. So I thought I should try out the new VIP +18 theatre in Windermere for date night. These are the reasons why I did not enjoy my experience in the VIP+18 theatres.

1. Beware of choosing seats
I decided to buy my tickets online so I could just walk in to the theatre. I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to buy online and even better, choose your seat! That's a really neat idea since the whole reason I chose to order online was because we're usually late and have to suffer to find seats, so this way my seats are reserved and waiting for us even if we're late. The only downside is that the online version didn't tell me how they split the seats, they have trays every two seats and when you're buying a pair and don't choose correctly you'll have a pair of trays in between you and your date. I regret not reading the reviews before because than I would've been aware of this problem, instead I got separated from my boyfriend and had the ""intimate seating"" with a stranger. So when buying in pairs choose (1+2), (3+4), not (2+3)

2. Service
A major reason for deciding to go with the VIP and paying the extra money, instead of normal was that I wanted to feel catered to, which is what VIP is advertising, someone will come and ask for your order and serve your food to you. Did I feel special, important or in any other terms like a VIP? No, what I felt was ignored. We did arrive early and came and sat down in our seats, looked at our menu and were ready to order the things we wanted. After about 10-15 minutes of watching other people being catered to and serviced, we didn't know whether someone would come to us, or how we should order, so we decided to ask a waiter and he said he'd be with us in a minute. We watched him ask the row sitting behind us if they were ok, then skip my row and continue onto the row in front of us and ask people for their orders, once he was done that, he looked at our row and then walked away. This is when the lights went dark and the trailers started to play. Annoyed, I decided to get up and go to the concession stand on my own to get the things I wanted, hoping I wouldn't miss the beginning of the movie. I passed him in the hall twice, as he was getting other people's orders and witnessed him take more customer's orders, so why couldn't he take my order? As I was getting my food from the concession stand, I overheard another lady complain about the service to the manager, and that she too had to get up during the beginning of her movie. I mean this is the reason you pay extra for a VIP ticket, its the service, then to completely fail in service is just a waste of money. 

3. Uncomfortable Seats
Throughout the whole movie, I had to readjust myself to try and find a comfortable position and by the looks of it, my intimate seating partner had the same problem. These seats were wider, made out of some type of leather imitation and had more leg room, all very good things but they weren't put together very well. They weren't able to recline as much as the other types of seats. I've actually been to the AVX theatre and those seats are more comfortable than the VIP for a lower price. In the end, I just had to deal with the back pain that the seats left me with. 

Overall, I was extremely disappointed with the experience, it was definitely not worth the money I paid. I will not be paying again for a VIP ticket, but I will come back for their other features such as the AVX, MFX D-BOX and their normal viewing theatres as I enjoy those experiences better for a lower price.",this is a review for the vip theatres im a giant fan of going out to see movies on the big screen i always love the experience so i thought i should try out the new vip theatre in windermere for date night these are the reasons why i did not enjoy my experience in the vip theatres beware of choosing seats i decided to buy my tickets online so i could just walk in to the theatre i was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to buy online and even better choose your seat thats a really neat idea since the whole reason i chose to order online was because were usually late and have to suffer to find seats so this way my seats are reserved and waiting for us even if were late the only downside is that the online version didnt tell me how they split the seats they have trays every two seats and when youre buying a pair and dont choose correctly youll have a pair of trays in between you and your date i regret not reading the reviews before because than i wouldve been aware of this problem instead i got separated from my boyfriend and had the intimate seating with a stranger so when buying in pairs choose not service a major reason for deciding to go with the vip and paying the extra money instead of normal was that i wanted to feel catered to which is what vip is advertising someone will come and ask for your order and serve your food to you did i feel special important or in any other terms like a vip no what i felt was ignored we did arrive early and came and sat down in our seats looked at our menu and were ready to order the things we wanted after about minutes of watching other people being catered to and serviced we didnt know whether someone would come to us or how we should order so we decided to ask a waiter and he said hed be with us in a minute we watched him ask the row sitting behind us if they were ok then skip my row and continue onto the row in front of us and ask people for their orders once he was done that he looked at our row and then walked away this is when the lights went dark and the trailers started to play annoyed i decided to get up and go to the concession stand on my own to get the things i wanted hoping i wouldnt miss the beginning of the movie i passed him in the hall twice as he was getting other peoples orders and witnessed him take more customers orders so why couldnt he take my order as i was getting my food from the concession stand i overheard another lady complain about the service to the manager and that she too had to get up during the beginning of her movie i mean this is the reason you pay extra for a vip ticket its the service then to completely fail in service is just a waste of money uncomfortable seats throughout the whole movie i had to readjust myself to try and find a comfortable position and by the looks of it my intimate seating partner had the same problem these seats were wider made out of some type of leather imitation and had more leg room all very good things but they werent put together very well they werent able to recline as much as the other types of seats ive actually been to the avx theatre and those seats are more comfortable than the vip for a lower price in the end i just had to deal with the back pain that the seats left me with overall i was extremely disappointed with the experience it was definitely not worth the money i paid i will not be paying again for a vip ticket but i will come back for their other features such as the avx mfx dbox and their normal viewing theatres as i enjoy those experiences better for a lower price

kgPzEQ7oUMfEQHSPrxEtQQ,1.0,"I came here a few months ago and I was SO FURIOUS I forgot to write a review. That never happens. 

I'm going to start off by saying AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS. I would rather ride public transportation than give these rude people my money. 

I had appointment at six. I get there at 5:45 and no on acknowledges me other than subtle glares. I can't tell who works there and who doesn't.  I finally muster up the courage to ask someone and they just point at another desk. No words. Just a lazy point. 

I get with a really young girl (not that this is a bad thing, I'm a young girl and I know my cars from working in the auto repair industry. Anything is possible). I tell her what I'm looking for, which is a 05-13 model smaller sedan, most important to me would be mileage and reliability, but above all I DO NOT WANT AN AMERICAN CAR. 

THIS IS THE WORST PART I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO INSULTED BY SOME SCRAWNY LITTLE FRESH OUTTA HIGH SCHOOL FALSE SENSE OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT CARS BRAT IN MY WHOLE LIFE: 

So she comes out with a feigned sense of excitement and dangles a set of keys, and shouts ""let's go test drive YOUR new car!!!"" I stop. I know those stupid keys anywhere. That's a brand new Ford. I repeat, ""I do not want an American car."" She visibly deflated, rolled her eyes, and said ""It's a running car."" 

OH. NO. 

Well miss thing, I'd rather have my NOT running car than your snotty holier-than-thou attitude. To be honest she was probably just saving face about the fact that she didn't know the difference between an American and non-American car. 

I kept my cool, because I REALLY needed a commuter car. She ended up pulling out a Toyota yaris that was kinda cute but not really my style, I test drove it and was willing to settle, as I presumed she pulled it because it met my requirements of $400 out of pocket max and $500 down payment. 

Nope. We get down to paperwork and it's going to be something like $480 a month and $1500 down. At this point I'm done wasting time, and I tell them I'll get back to them and leave. 

A few days later they call me and tell me they can get me in a 2017 Mitsubishi Mirage with my $500 down, but it'll still be more than $480/month and they'll use the rebate as the rest of my down payment. I said no thank you and shopped local instead. I'm still paying crazy amounts of interest, but at least the local guys were honest when they screwed me over.

It just really bothers me that this place obviously tries to pull the wool over the eyes of consumers who they presume know nothing about cars or financing. No thanks, I'm fine.",i came here a few months ago and i was so furious i forgot to write a review that never happens im going to start off by saying avoid this place at all costs i would rather ride public transportation than give these rude people my money i had appointment at six i get there at and no on acknowledges me other than subtle glares i cant tell who works there and who doesnt i finally muster up the courage to ask someone and they just point at another desk no words just a lazy point i get with a really young girl not that this is a bad thing im a young girl and i know my cars from working in the auto repair industry anything is possible i tell her what im looking for which is a model smaller sedan most important to me would be mileage and reliability but above all i do not want an american car this is the worst part i have never been so insulted by some scrawny little fresh outta high school false sense of knowledge about cars brat in my whole life so she comes out with a feigned sense of excitement and dangles a set of keys and shouts lets go test drive your new car i stop i know those stupid keys anywhere thats a brand new ford i repeat i do not want an american car she visibly deflated rolled her eyes and said its a running car oh no well miss thing id rather have my not running car than your snotty holierthanthou attitude to be honest she was probably just saving face about the fact that she didnt know the difference between an american and nonamerican car i kept my cool because i really needed a commuter car she ended up pulling out a toyota yaris that was kinda cute but not really my style i test drove it and was willing to settle as i presumed she pulled it because it met my requirements of out of pocket max and down payment nope we get down to paperwork and its going to be something like a month and down at this point im done wasting time and i tell them ill get back to them and leave a few days later they call me and tell me they can get me in a mitsubishi mirage with my down but itll still be more than month and theyll use the rebate as the rest of my down payment i said no thank you and shopped local instead im still paying crazy amounts of interest but at least the local guys were honest when they screwed me over it just really bothers me that this place obviously tries to pull the wool over the eyes of consumers who they presume know nothing about cars or financing no thanks im fine

_uDhUdcNBtgiOXPGPWunoQ,5.0,"The name says it all. If you want something other than fish tacos, look elsewhere. If you're looking for some really tasty fish tacos for shockingly reasonable prices, then this is most definitely the place.

This restaurant is associated with the food truck of the same name on Grant and 6th, so if you've had a taco from that truck, then you know what to expect. Prices say $2.50 for one fish taco, but they give you four pieces of fish per ""taco"" and 2 corn tortillas, so in reality it's $1.25 per fish taco. That's cheaper than the fish taco Tuesday special at Rubio's, and these fish tacos are a hell of a lot tastier, too. Win-win all around. The shrimp taco costs the same ($2.50 for ""2""), the marlin is only $3.00, and yes, they are very delicious as well. All tacos come bare (save for a little bit of mayo or cream on the bottom of the taco), but the condiment table has just about everything you could want. The green cilantro sauce is especially refreshing. A dab of that mixed with a bit of the chipotle crema, and I'm in fish taco heaven.

The location is interesting, because while it looks like a regular indoor restaurant from the front, there is no back wall in the dining area, and so eating here is kind of like eating at a very sturdy, very large, immobile food truck. They've got a garage air conditioner and a mesh screen to provide some shade for those sitting close to the back, and so the dining area is nice and cool. I liked it.

The only flaws against it are the limited parking and the difficult-to-find...ness... It's extremely easy to miss if you're like me and oblivious to signs that aren't made of metal and lights, so remember to look out for the red and blue flag-banner that reads ""Taco Fish.""

When you call back, they have a million excuses. We've requested our dishwasher to be replaced since we moved in more than 30 times and they won't fix the issue. We finally hired a plumber who advised us that they used improper plumbing materials and that is what is ruining our dishes and causing the dishwasher to not work properly. They charge so much to live here that you'd expect anything better than this. The front desk staff members are incredibly fake and rude as well. I'd recommend looking anywhere else and for this price, maybe even a house.

Update: 
So after having the maintenance come to make repairs for the 6th time, because of Shannon's response here on yelp requesting I do so-the maintenance guy, Adam threw a massive tantrum inside of my home. First telling me I need to pay the front office $17 monthly for cleaner to use the dishwasher. Then after his cleaner didn't work, he told me that he doesn't know why the dishwasher is not working properly and began to argue that the plumber I hired isn't correct, but not knowing himself how to fix the problem-insisting that the problem isn't fixable and telling me to stop making repair orders. I demanded that he leave my apartment. So thanks sundown, for again, not fixing the problem and then having your staff treat me rudely inside of my home.

3M2zIKwVz2J63SlNiirgVA,3.0,"Another strip mall. Another Mexican Restaurant. Precisely. But is this one any good? Is is better than the rest or more of the same? I think it's somewhere in the middle. It was a beautiful day outside for early July so my friend and I thought it would be neat to eat lunch on the patio.  Here comes the chips and salsa. The chips were fresh and tasty. The salsa was bland and watery. San Jose's have an expanded lunch menu. I ordered the Pollo Loco and while the delicious chicken was marinated in a citrus based dressing and char grilled to perfection the 3 ounce breast was small and flat as a tortilla.  A small guacamole salad on a bed of shredded lettuce and a side of spice free mexican rice completed the luncheon entree. Not much happening here for $8.00. My friend ordered the lunch fajitas. Tasty strips of steak with a nice garlic overtone accompanied by green pepper strips, diced onion and quartered tomatoes. It was good but the steak strips were few and far between. Once again, skimpy on the protein. The fajitas came on a plate rather than a traditional sizzling skillet. Portioned rice, soupy refried beans, exceptionally chewy tortillas and pico relish completed the luncheon fajita dish. Once again, not a whole lot for $8.00. Beware! If you want to experience the restaurant's hotter salsa you will be charged accordingly. All in all, San Jose is a decent mexican restaurant. Not a stand out. Would I go back. Possibly.

CU90LyF40t62BRWyzHO29A,5.0,"I understand that some people - particularly environmentalists - have issues with zoos. They are intrinsically uncomfortable with the idea of humans imprisoning other animals for entertainment.

It may not be PC to admit it, but I've always loved zoos, because I love the animals they contain and cherish the chance to see those animals in person. 

That's not to say that I didn't feel bad about seeing animals in cages. So I'm overjoyed that accredited professional zoos have become MUCH better about creating humane and naturalistic exhibits where animals have space to roam and relax in a space that at least resembles their natural habitat.

(I'm not saying this eliminates the moral issues of caging animals, but the animals in naturalistic exhibits seem much happier to me. Think of it this way: If you were captured by an alien species and put on exhibit for all the other aliens to see, would you rather be in a bare jail cell (old-fashioned zoo) or a comfortable house (modern zoo)?)

I also believe that at a time of widespread environmental destruction and species extinction, people are most likely to care about saving animals they love. And it's hard to love an animal you only see on the TV, the Internet or a magazine. (For more on this point, see  - http://blogs.plos.org/scied/2013/03/11/zoo-education/)

Plus zoos nowadays play an important role in the breeding of rare animals. At Nashville, for instance, the zoo breeds obviously adorable clouded leopards and surprisingly adorable giant anteaters - http://www.zooborns.com/zooborns/nashville-zoo/

So how do Nashville zoo compare to other zoos I've visited? I'd say our zoo is emblematic of Nashville itself - it's friendly, not too big, not too small, well-maintained, well-designed, well-managed and generally a joy to visit. Most of the animals seem to have plenty of room in which to maneuver -- and to put some distance between themselves and human visitors if they (the animals) want some peace and quiet. I think that the elephants, for instance, have the largest exhibit I've ever seen at a zoo. They seemed much happier and more mellow than elephants I've seen at other zoos. 

This does mean that some visitors - particularly the ones who grew up visiting zoos where the animals were constantly on view (because they were in tiny cages) may occasionally get frustrated if they can't always spot an animal in an a jungle exhibit filled with trees and rocks for the animals to hide behind.

(And if you come during the hottest part of the day, particularly in the summertime, don't be surprised if many animals are doing the smart thing and napping in the shade.)

But there are plenty of other animals you're almost guaranteed to see - including tigers, meerkats (fascinating to watch and you can see them very close-up), lots of snakes and lizards in an indoor exhibit, alligators, zebras, giraffes, a petting zoo, a flock of flamingos, etc.

And then there's the newest jewel in the crown - Kangaroo Kickabout, where you can walk on a path through a mob of kangaroos. Yes, a group of kangaroos is really called a ""mob"" (learned that yesterday at the zoo) and yes, there are no walls or barriers between you and the roos. The zoo does ask that visitors stay on the path -- I'm guessing that's so the roos don't feel threatened or cornered. When we visited, the roos were all pretty much napping or gnawing on bark (which they like to eat when there are no grasses or grains growing). It was a very peaceful scene.

Is the zoo perfect? Some of the signage could be better, particularly in the elephant and giraffe areas. (The signs direct you to countries indicative of the animals natural habitats - Botswana, for instance - but the zoo map doesn't list those countries, so it's slightly confusing. We ended up just following the map, which was easy enough to do, and ignoring the signs.)

And of course, it would be nice if the zoo had a few more types of animals. I'd love to be able to see lions, gorillas, bears and aquatic life such as otters or seals. I think it would be great if there were a section featuring Tennessee animals. Not just farm animals, but local critters like opossums, raccoons, black bears, white-tailed deer, armadillos and so forth. 

But building safe, beautiful and comfortable exhibits for the animals takes time. I'd rather the Nashville Zoo build one world-class exhibit rather than 5 sub-par exhibits.
 
The zoo is expanding and it does (I believe) have a Master Plan to get bigger and better. For instance, I believe we may be getting some more monkeys next year! I do hope the zoo won't lose any of its current charm and friendliness as it continues to grow.

So whether you're a visitor or a local, please visit the zoo.

DbARcEuX6NvWN_hSQKHMJg,5.0,"This is one of my favorite places to visit in Tampa! I can't think of a better place to visit on a Sunday. I've been coming here since before it was so well known. Over the years word has gotten out and more and more people venture out. The temple has even remodeled the outdoor space with railings along the water and a larger sitting area as well. 

When it comes to the food there are tons of options from soup to fresh rolls with peanut sauce. But let's be honest, the best thing to get is the PAD THAI and the CURRIES. It usually costs $7 for the pad Thai and $5 for the curry which is an unbeatable price compared to anywhere else. You can even buy orchids and other plants. I bought my desert rose for $2.50 and 7 years later it is still thriving. I have such fond memories with different friends over the years and will continue to visit when I crave curry on Sunday's.

A huge tip is if you are going just for the curry, make sure you go around 10am as I have had them run out by 11am before. I about cried when they told me there was no curry left. Like I had to re-learn how to live my life. Also make sure you bring CASH as it's cash only and you'll be very hungry if you don't bring it. Lastly, parking can be tough so going earlier is better usually.

Where you order your food is on a wooden wrap around back porch. You walk down steps to an outdoor communal picnic table seating. Sometimes it can be difficult to find a seat if it's really busy. There are views of the river which is quite relaxing to be able to walk along the water and to even observe the Buddhist temple for a different cultural experience. It truly feels like you transport to another country even though you are in Tampa.",this is one of my favorite places to visit in tampa i cant think of a better place to visit on a sunday ive been coming here since before it was so well known over the years word has gotten out and more and more people venture out the temple has even remodeled the outdoor space with railings along the water and a larger sitting area as well when it comes to the food there are tons of options from soup to fresh rolls with peanut sauce but lets be honest the best thing to get is the pad thai and the curries it usually costs for the pad thai and for the curry which is an unbeatable price compared to anywhere else you can even buy orchids and other plants i bought my desert rose for and years later it is still thriving i have such fond memories with different friends over the years and will continue to visit when i crave curry on sundays a huge tip is if you are going just for the curry make sure you go around am as i have had them run out by am before i about cried when they told me there was no curry left like i had to relearn how to live my life also make sure you bring cash as its cash only and youll be very hungry if you dont bring it lastly parking can be tough so going earlier is better usually where you order your food is on a wooden wrap around back porch you walk down steps to an outdoor communal picnic table seating sometimes it can be difficult to find a seat if its really busy there are views of the river which is quite relaxing to be able to walk along the water and to even observe the buddhist temple for a different cultural experience it truly feels like you transport to another country even though you are in tampa

I had been craving tostones for months having moved back from NYC. When things are readily available, you take them for granted. My search in Indy led to me all of the friend recommended spots and sadly I was disappointed. Havana Cafe solved this problem! Their tostones appetizer was exactly what I needed and their chicken empanadas were something I didn't even know I needed. 

Being that Havana Cafe is about 10 minutes from my house, I've been here more than I probably should have. I definitely recommend the aforementioned items, but also the arroz con pollo. 

Tip: They take call ahead orders if you're in a hurry, but I've never waited too long and they have free parking...non-downtown location advantages.

The nurse called at 6:40 PM sharp, helped us through the standard registration and pre-appointment procedures, and in less than ten minutes, we were on and off the phone with a doctor who prescribed us the test and instructed us to get to Vybe as soon as we could before they stopped doing swab tests at 7:15.  A short five minute drive and an even shorter 2-3 minute test and we were out the door.

We made the mistake of ordering on Google through a third-party called Slice. When we received our food, it was the most disgusting thing I've ever seen/had. My daughter's chicken fingers looked worst than microwaveable chicken nuggets. Our pizza was dough was RAW in the middle. We called to see if we could take the food back, and get a refund. The lady who answered was extremely rude off the bat; told us there was nothing she could do because we had ordered through a third-party (which they provide.) She said she did not recommend ordering through the third-party, and told us we needed to call next time to order. Understandable, but this is a service that you provide to your customers and if you do not recommend it, I do not understand why you guys are even in a contract with them. We called Slice to get our money back, and they told us the restaurant was not approving the refund because to them the order was made ""correctly.""

Each time we've gone to Legacy we've received good customer service and we've never had to wait long for a chair. They're walk in only and in my experience, rarely super busy. I feel like the price for the pedicure is worth the money. Obviously I don't do polish or anything like that, but the calf massage, foot scrub, exfoliation, and hot towel are welcomed additions to the clipping/filing. 

The only things I'll ding them on is the massage aspect of those chairs are, at least to me, not comfortable or relaxing in the slightest. I always just keep the massage feature off. Also, I keep forgetting that if you're paying by card, you have to ask them to add their tip amount to the total BEFORE the swipe it.

PP3BBaVxZLcJU54uP_wL6Q,4.0,"Pat's was my longtime front-runner in the infamous Philadelphia cheesesteak war, and still remains a top-contender. When you visit Philadelphia, people will tell you to head to Pat's for it's reputation alone, as well as it's location right next to the other top contender, Geno's Steaks. 

In my opinion, cheesesteaks are something very difficult to rate. Some people like Cheese Whiz, others prefer provolone. Some prefer their steak chopped up, others like it still in slices. 

Pat's uses a great roll for the bread, soft and as good as those used by any other place. They then slather it with Cheese Whiz and top it with chopped prime rib steak. It's a great cheesesteak, and their cheese fries are an incredible addition to an already filling meal. 


It's a little on the pricey side, but so are all of the big name cheesesteak places (Pat's, Geno's, Tony Luke's, and Jim's). It's also unfortunately a little out of the way for a lot of people, but if you are just visiting the city I would absolutely recommend you try it. 

I give it four stars simply because there are better options in the city when you have time to explore. Jim's is delicious and probably my favorite of the big-4, with Tony Luke's and Pat's tied for 2nd. 

Overall, it's a great place for tourists to visit, and the fun of choosing a side on the Pat's vs. Geno's war is half the reason to go. If you live in the city, there are better options, cheaper options, and a lot of preference to be had.

vBd2-H4sQM1hq3ggWNambw,3.0,"This spring in New Orleans has been fantastic for outdoor dining.  So when Bordeaux opened, we were excited to try it.  They have a fantastic outdoor seating area in a decent area to people watch.  The weather was perfect.  Our server Larry was an extremely nice and attentive.  From an atmosphere and service perspective, we loved it.  

So now to talk about the food.  I had the lamb shoulder.  I like lamb shoulder.  It tends to have a decent marbling and I like lamb in general.  The cut of meat was decent but the sauce was really dull.  It's hard to describe the sauce because of the absence of flavor I associate with it.  I did not think it was bad, but it was just this bland yellowish sauce.  Very little flavor.  

On the other side of the table, Shari V had the red snapper.   It was a pretty piece of fish but same problem...no flavor.  She actually salted the fish and then took some of her water lemon wedges and squeezed them onto the snapper.  This was a desperate move.  

In short, 2 stars for the food.  They seem to have decent quality ingredients.  Unfortunately, the dishes did not come together for us.  I doubt we will repeat.",this spring in new orleans has been fantastic for outdoor dining so when bordeaux opened we were excited to try it they have a fantastic outdoor seating area in a decent area to people watch the weather was perfect our server larry was an extremely nice and attentive from an atmosphere and service perspective we loved it so now to talk about the food i had the lamb shoulder i like lamb shoulder it tends to have a decent marbling and i like lamb in general the cut of meat was decent but the sauce was really dull its hard to describe the sauce because of the absence of flavor i associate with it i did not think it was bad but it was just this bland yellowish sauce very little flavor on the other side of the table shari v had the red snapper it was a pretty piece of fish but same problemno flavor she actually salted the fish and then took some of her water lemon wedges and squeezed them onto the snapper this was a desperate move in short stars for the food they seem to have decent quality ingredients unfortunately the dishes did not come together for us i doubt we will repeat

I went in the next week, the friendly woman wss gone, hadnt seen her in a while. Only these rude smart alec millinials.

zeE4rZhbaKBwvA4WaZ6_ig,5.0,"This is one of Margaret Kuo's restaurants (in fact where she started), and the food is just as good as any of her others. It is located by the mall, but it's not the typical Americanized Chinese restaurants you find near other malls. It has both Americanized and authentic Chinese food, the latter of which requires you to ask for a Chinese menu. 

Interestingly, while the name of the restaurant suggests northern Chinese food, this restaurant actually serves more Shanghai-style dishes, ranging from the popular steamed juicy pork buns (which belong to the casual dim sum category), to more sophisticated banquet food including appetizers and entrees that require a lot of preparation. We tried wonton soup, drunken chicken, five-spice beef, salty duck, and Wuxi-style ribs, and they looked and tasted on par with what you would expect of a fine restaurant in Shanghai.

The restaurant is clean and nicely decorated, and the wait staff is very friendly and accommodating. They also have Japanese food, which seems quite popular as well but we have yet to try out.

They seem to begrudge the delivery services that they partner with like Doordash and Grubhub for example. They charge exorbitant delivery fees on top of what the services themselves already charge and then I tip the driver on top of it because when you've worked in the service industry, you're hopefully not a garbage person who cheaps out.

My project was a disaster that begun the night they installed.  Everything looked beautiful but after  installers left & I signed the certification of satisfactory I noticed a blown out electrical outlet that fried the circuit breaker in my side bedroom & found out that installers had trouble with the plug and made the lights flicker. There was flooding in basement due to pipe connections done wrong, showerhead connection leaking after the 1st attempt to repair.  It took 4 visits and complete removal wall to get the leaks fixed.  By now construction mess left behind in wash room from cutting into my floor boards and bathroom flooring had to be redone because of the installers walking on freshly grouted tiles. Manager Ray asked about the electrical problem I explained I had added costs of $750 to repair due to surge from installers. There was no further response for over a week until today a message from the Office Manager Trisha Dekis, threatening late fees on the balance of $627.  I am not one to run to a lawyer but its the principal of the matter.

It was pretty darn busy (a Sunday around 3p). There were quite a few groups waiting for a table. Good thing I just wanted some take-out baked goods! I made my way back to the bakery counter and marveled at all of my options. I immediately noticed that there were samples out! - Pumpkin Gooey Butter Cheesecake. The texture was smooth and creamy and the flavor was right on target! 

However, I also spotted a Pumpkin Praline Cheesecake. I asked the lady at the counter how they compared and which she preferred. She immediately pulled the cake out, talked me through the layers and gave me a small sample on a fork. The crust tasted like a sugar cookie - sweet and chewy. The pumpkin cheesecake had all the cinnamon/nutmeg/allspice goin' on that you want when you think of fall and Thanksgiving! And the top was covered in a layer of praline pecans!! This was definitely even better than the Gooey Butter! (Also, have you ever tried the Pecan Pumpkin Cheesecake at Cheesecake Factory? This is better!!!)

The Death By Chocolate also caught my eye - I was given another sample. On the bottom - a chewy, fudgey brownie. On top of that, a layer of chocolate mousse topped with whipped cream. The whole thing was light and fluffy and not overly sweet.

ae1mjuaLmdYq5K5ltCO5Ww,5.0,"UPDATE: a couple of days after the service that never was, the owner Tracy contacted me. She apologized for the fact that I was not offered a shorter service, like a classic bikini, and asked if I would like to come in and receive a complementary service, just so I could actually experience a wax from them. I decided to give it a try, and I am glad I did. Tracy put me at ease (I was pretty nervous, as waxing is never a pleasant experience) but most importantly, she did an excellent job. Her technique is much less painful than I was used to in Hawaii (we just moved to Tucson from HI), and she is very thorough and meticulous. I will be coming back, as a great job on such an intimate service is worth the drive. She never asked me to update my review to receive a complimentary service, which I appreciate, but I am updating it anyway because I do feel the actual service was excellent and it would not be fair for me to receive a service and not review it. I will recommend this waxing salon to others, but with very explicit directions on how to find it! 

Original Review: I would give this place zero stars, if I could. I just got home from wasting two hours of my life, for nothing. I could not tell you how their work is, because I did not receive any service! I had an appointment booked, and was in the TMC Emergency Room with my 5 year-old on the day of service and wasn't sure if we would be out in time for me to go all the way home (we live in Corona), drop her off, and get back, so I called to reschedule. I rescheduled for today at 5:30 (the only time I had, rush hour is never ideal), and drove 45 minutes from my home in Corona to this wax place. I arrived in the area at my appointment time, but could not find their business- we just moved here, so I am already not familiar with the area, and I don't know if their business is small or what, because I never found it. I called to ask where exactly they were located since I was lost, (I was a little past it, at Albertsons) and the girl that answered said they were next to Dunkin' Donuts, so I put Dunkin' Donuts into my GPS and drove the quarter mile and called from Dunkin' since I still did not see their store front, even though it was supposed to be in that area. The girl that answers said that since I was TWO MINUTES past the 10 minute ""grace period,"" Raquel would not give me my service. I understand that she had other customers, but she could have offered a shorter service, like a classic bikini, instead of a Brazilian. Nope! Just ""you have to reschedule."" I drove 90 minutes round trip for NOTHING. I could understand if I was a regular customer just waltzing in late, but as someone very new to the area and to their business, you would think they would try to work with their customer and help them, not waste hours of their time. If anyone can recommend a great place closer to South Tucson/Vail, I'd love to hear it so I can try it, and put it on the list I'm compiling for other new, incoming military families. This place obviously has enough business, they don't need new customers. :/",update a couple of days after the service that never was the owner tracy contacted me she apologized for the fact that i was not offered a shorter service like a classic bikini and asked if i would like to come in and receive a complementary service just so i could actually experience a wax from them i decided to give it a try and i am glad i did tracy put me at ease i was pretty nervous as waxing is never a pleasant experience but most importantly she did an excellent job her technique is much less painful than i was used to in hawaii we just moved to tucson from hi and she is very thorough and meticulous i will be coming back as a great job on such an intimate service is worth the drive she never asked me to update my review to receive a complimentary service which i appreciate but i am updating it anyway because i do feel the actual service was excellent and it would not be fair for me to receive a service and not review it i will recommend this waxing salon to others but with very explicit directions on how to find it original review i would give this place zero stars if i could i just got home from wasting two hours of my life for nothing i could not tell you how their work is because i did not receive any service i had an appointment booked and was in the tmc emergency room with my yearold on the day of service and wasnt sure if we would be out in time for me to go all the way home we live in corona drop her off and get back so i called to reschedule i rescheduled for today at the only time i had rush hour is never ideal and drove minutes from my home in corona to this wax place i arrived in the area at my appointment time but could not find their business we just moved here so i am already not familiar with the area and i dont know if their business is small or what because i never found it i called to ask where exactly they were located since i was lost i was a little past it at albertsons and the girl that answered said they were next to dunkin donuts so i put dunkin donuts into my gps and drove the quarter mile and called from dunkin since i still did not see their store front even though it was supposed to be in that area the girl that answers said that since i was two minutes past the minute grace period raquel would not give me my service i understand that she had other customers but she could have offered a shorter service like a classic bikini instead of a brazilian nope just you have to reschedule i drove minutes round trip for nothing i could understand if i was a regular customer just waltzing in late but as someone very new to the area and to their business you would think they would try to work with their customer and help them not waste hours of their time if anyone can recommend a great place closer to south tucsonvail id love to hear it so i can try it and put it on the list im compiling for other new incoming military families this place obviously has enough business they dont need new customers

SVSafDWg9r2Q5XEVOLPSSA,2.0,"Went here after reading Yelp reviews when I was craving dim sum.  Sigh.  In this instance, Yelpers led me to have higher expectations than warranted.  We had the roast duck, cashew chicken, some noodle dish, and a couple of dim sum sides.
On the positive side: the food was cheap and plentiful, and the service was very prompt and friendly.  
On the negative side: the quality of the food wasn't particularly good, everything was way too salty and greasy, and the dim sum menu was the smallest I've ever seen at a restaurant that offers it.  It all seemed much more ""American Chinese Food"" than ""Chinese Food"" to me.

I was able to scour the sale items (as I always do) and found a really cute coin purse that I was able to get the manager to give me an extra 10% off because it was the last one and had some minor scuff marks that I could live with.  I was also able to find a nice big beach hat for $5 that was also marked down.  I already got a compliment on the hat at the next store I visited :)

That coupled with the fact that I hadn't been on a bicycle probably since freshmen year of high school gave me slight anxiety over going on the bike tour. 5 mins in I was that girl holding everyone up because I was last lol but shortly after we started off I was good. :) 

The tour guide CASSADY was fabulous!! He was so knowledgable about the city and really went out of his way to accomodate everyone in the group. Whether there was a certain part of the city you wanted to see or a landmark you wanted to know more about Cassady was open to switching up the tour to make sure everyone saw what they wanted. He also offered his cell phone number to us and we were able to get all kinds of recommendations from him regarding great spots for food and music.

The tour was very enjoyable and there was alot of laughing. Other bike tour companies would sometimes pass us while we were riding around the city and you could tell they wanted to be a part of our group. Their tour guide looked old and boring.

The money is definitely worth it and we tipped Cassady at the end just because with his information and enthusiasm he really helped us kick off our visit to Nola.

pD8sfUMm2pwmbu_RVww4BA,3.0,"I was kinda disappointed to be honest. I have walked past here a thousand times and was expecting the hand carved beef to taste as good as it looks and smells. The beef itself is tender, lean and ample, however, where's the flavor?  Maybe I was expecting too much for the $8 sandwich?  It was on a fresh roll, and the horseradish is the sinus clearing variety you would expect from a good beef joint. However, the beef was lacking in seasoning and the ""au jus"" that came with it, was flavorless (and that's being generous).  Don't get me wrong, I don't want the seasoning to overpower the flavor of the beef, but c'mon, give me a little something to enhance the beef and at least hint of slow roasted goodness. Nope.

Time change! Time for breakfast because we got to sleep in!  I had a girls night sleepover so everyone was feeling lazy and I wasn't in the mood to cook, so off in search of a place to have breakfast. We tried 2 familiar spots, but both had people waiting in line through the door. I remembered this place as a possibility to try, so we were lucky - got in just in time to be seated immediately. We hungrily watched as other plates were delivered. Man, those pancakes were huge and looked delicious.

I ordered the housemade challah bread French toast. It was good, but needed a bit more sweetness. Coffee was never ending, fresh and hot.

Another dining partner ordered her usual 2 eggs over medium with corned beef hash - also got a thumbs up, but something was missing. Was it a low sodium version? Maybe more onions than usual? Just different. The breakfast potatoes were good.

The youngest diner ordered a waffle and a side of bacon, which unfortunately came undercooked and limp. A miss for sure.

6OBV0LXFHVQoUWuQxJxtwA,1.0,"Wife and I ate here on a Saturday afternoon (before dinner rush). The food sucked. I had general Tso's chicken with fried rice, and added a side of noodles. The rice was really dry (no egg, no veggies, I first thought it was just brown rice) , noodles taste like burnt oil (almost smoky, in not a good way), and the chicken tasted like something microwaved, maybe fried, then tossed in pre made sauce. I don't know why they labeled it as spicy on the menu. It was very mild and I'm not convinced they didn't confuse it for the orange chicken sauce. My broccoli was also cold. 

My wife got a sashimi plate . The cuts were inconsistent and the fish was not fresh. Some pieces were fresh, but other cuts (hacks of fish) were very fishy and not fresh tasting. All were cut poorly, as shown in the photo. I RARELY leave reviews but this was ridiculous. They had some kid who didn't look like he knew what he was doing running the sushi bar by himself and it was a joke. 

We also ordered a roll. It took much longer than our other plates to arrive. It was maybe a 2/5 in terms of taste and quality. The fried shrimp in the roll was not tempura. Looked like it was fried in the same shit as everything else. 

Everything that came out of the kitchen seemed relatively lazy and lackluster. I could understand if the place was packed/busy, but it wasn't. It was at maybe 25% capacity. 

Wife said her miso soup and salad was decent. 

The cocktails, while affordable, weren't potent or well made. I don't know what kind of Mai Tai comes in a 22 oz glass or tastes like some sort of lemonade but it was garbage. Isn't this Nashville??!! (close enough, anyway) I would have rather paid twice as much for a well made cocktail with half the volume. At least a good cocktail would have helped salvage the cruddy food. 

Our waiter was nice, but inexperienced. Pretty sure he was wearing sweatpants. 

This is definitely not authentic Asian cuisine. Hell, I would have enjoyed Panda Express more than this garbage. They have a lot on their menu, but aren't good at particularly anything. 

Not to mention they sat people right next to us -- during a pandemic -- indoors -- when they had ample seating to space to seat us farther apart.

PY9GRfzr4nTZeINf346QOw,5.0,"By far the nicest casino I've been to in Reno. They have the largest gaming floor and more slot machines you can count. I'm new to ""gambling"" so it was a lot to take in. I tried my luck on a handful of slots on the main floors in different areas and did not get much of a return. 

They have a few themed dining areas. The island buffet looks so impressive from the outside! Almost like looking in to an indoor rainforest!! I did not get to eat there, so I don't have any suggestions to add on their food.

The ""Eleganza"" room was the best. I will not say how much I won but it was a nice payout. All the staff here were friendly and very accommodating. The bartender in the Eleganza room was really nice and so was the floor attendant. I recommend you stop by and play in this particular room because it's completely worth it... In my experience.

We will definitely be back to stay in their hotel.

Server was amazing wish I could remember her name, and even on a Friday night the hostess were very accommodating as we booked on OpenTable and we had selected inside; someway somehow we ended up outside, during the cold, since there was no preference marked on their end. 
But in less than five minutes we were sat inside which was a huge plus.

P1Oxdcr6lZtzg2onGYXAww,4.0,"I have eaten here twice and have really enjoyed both experiences.  The first time we visited we did not have a reservation so our party of 4 sat at bar.  We recognized the bartender from a previous employer - so he set us up with an amuse-bouche of the deviled eggs......absolutely delish.  We then ordered our entrees (I got the grouper and he got the flat iron steak).  Both were very good and fresh.  We all split the mac & cheese and this was the highlight of the meal.  The wines are a little unknown but decently priced.

The second time we came was for a birthday party of 15.  They put us in the private room and it would have been tight had there been more people.  We only had one waitress but she great!  They were very accommodating and our meal was very enjoyable.  My only complaint was that my fish (I had the grouper again) was overdone - but I understand that it is very hard to fire 15 dishes to be finished all at the same time. 

This place is great for a party of 2 or a party of 20.  Just be sure to make reservations.  If you have to wait, there is a small central bar that will sit about 12 or so.  There is also a cool firepit outside that you can wait it out.

The waiter apologized and in another 15 minutes came back with one over hard egg.  The yolk didn't even break. By that time I didn't even care anymore and just ate it.

There's a connection between Marsha Brown's and Ruth's Chris steakhouse, so maybe that's why it's so good. But the menu isn't huge, but there are good and very interesting options. And everything is packed with flavor. The apps are great, the meals are great and so are the desserts (well, I only had dessert once because I was too stuffed the other times). If you love tasty, well made meals, you'll love it for that alone.

There's more, though. The service and atmosphere are second to none. If you go, make a reservation and ask to dine on the second floor. It's an old church and has an atmosphere you won't get anywhere else. Very unique. Want to impress a date, take him/her there. The wait staff I've experienced are amazing. Kind, polite, professional and the treat you like royalty.

The only downside is the cost. For two people, a drink or two and an app and you're not getting out of there for under $100 and that would be on the cheap side. You could spend $200 easy for a couple but it's money well spent.",first let me start with this if youre going to marsha browns save it for a special occasion unless youve got money to burn its pricey as pricey as any youd see in manhattan that being said the food here is out of this world ive been three times and each time came home stuffed and satisfied theres a connection between marsha browns and ruths chris steakhouse so maybe thats why its so good but the menu isnt huge but there are good and very interesting options and everything is packed with flavor the apps are great the meals are great and so are the desserts well i only had dessert once because i was too stuffed the other times if you love tasty well made meals youll love it for that alone theres more though the service and atmosphere are second to none if you go make a reservation and ask to dine on the second floor its an old church and has an atmosphere you wont get anywhere else very unique want to impress a date take himher there the wait staff ive experienced are amazing kind polite professional and the treat you like royalty the only downside is the cost for two people a drink or two and an app and youre not getting out of there for under and that would be on the cheap side you could spend easy for a couple but its money well spent

5m9QeYTx52m50MMR3Rr_wA,2.0,"I wanted to love this place - it seems like a fresh take on deli but the owner blew it with customer service. I ordered a $9.75 Turkey/Kale Salad wrap on a Friday. I had a limited time for lunch since I work at a nearby Drs office. I returned to the office with my wrap. The menu standard includes turkey on the wrap but the deli failed to put it on mine. I telephoned to say I was missing the turkey on the wrap and would like to try again on Monday perhaps a free or half price sandwich. I tried again on Monday and was given a price tag of $8.25 (owner states that is the price of the wrap if it had been prepared without turkey so he charged me for what Friday's wrap would have been -if I had asked for it without turkey- which I did not.) Customer Service is so important to me. Until I posted a bad comment the owner was not remorseful. His mom, who I phoned on the Friday did apologize. In an email he said "" I can't afford to give stuff away"".",i wanted to love this place it seems like a fresh take on deli but the owner blew it with customer service i ordered a turkeykale salad wrap on a friday i had a limited time for lunch since i work at a nearby drs office i returned to the office with my wrap the menu standard includes turkey on the wrap but the deli failed to put it on mine i telephoned to say i was missing the turkey on the wrap and would like to try again on monday perhaps a free or half price sandwich i tried again on monday and was given a price tag of owner states that is the price of the wrap if it had been prepared without turkey so he charged me for what fridays wrap would have been if i had asked for it without turkey which i did not customer service is so important to me until i posted a bad comment the owner was not remorseful his mom who i phoned on the friday did apologize in an email he said i cant afford to give stuff away
pDR3n7cjtbTrkgDxfUUDtw,1.0,"I was really debating betweeen 1 and 2 stars here. We used the living social Voucher. Even though I was on crutches from a recent knee surgery we were made to try to squeeze through a crowded bar area to a high top table in the back corner. This would be bad enough if there weren't normal open tables right in the front of the restaurant side. I get that they aren't expecting big business from living social customers, but if you are going to sell the voucher at least try to gain repeat business from it. Some people who buy vouchers can actually afford to pay full price for a nice meal, but after our experience I would never spend my money at Malios. Instead of trying to gain repeat business they just nickel and dime you on everything while you are there.

After struggling on one leg through the bar and into a high top table, we were given the pre fixed living social menu, which had very limited choices on it. In spite of the lmited options the restaurant made sure to print on the bottom that the meals actual value was $110 and we should be sure  to tip on that value. Really?? Very tacky. We ordered the fried mozzarella app, which tasted fine, but not much different from one I wold buy at any restaurant or in the frozen food section of the grocery store really. Then I got a very bland bowl of French onion soup, and my husband was given a tiny house salad. I ordered mahi for my entree, which I thought tasted good, and my husband ordered a steak that was overlooked. The entrees did not come with sides, so we ordered the homemade chips for $7, and they tasted like lays potato chips. I was expecting something like the awesome chips from datz.

After our entree was delivered, our server disappeared. We finally flagged her down after waiting about 15 minutes and asked for the dessert that was included in our meal, a slice of key lime pie, to go. We paid our bill and waited, and waited. My husband even stood up. The server came over after about 25 minutes to tell us It would just take a few more minutes to cut our slice of pie, put it in a box, and bring it out. I started maneuvering my crutches back out of the cramped bar area. My husband waited 5 more minutes and finally left without the pie. 30 minutes to cut a slice of pie? Am I missing something here?

After reading my own review I am downgrading this to 1 star. The only positive was the fish. For 2 drinks, some chips, and the tip on top of the full amount which our server also wrote in pen on top of the receipt (again, so tacky!) we paid $45 fo the meal plus $55 for the living social voucher. I would rather eat at outback for half that price.

I always get a dish of half Drunken Chicken and Spinach and Mushroom Etouffee. The Drunken Chicken is a stew with shredded chicken, rosemary, garlic, red pepper, beer and bread crumbs. The Spinach Etouffee is vegetarian and includes green curry, a creamy  mushroom sauce, spinach, and spices.

We ordered Ginger Beef with Bell Pepper and Onion, Lemongrass with Tofu, Satay Chicken on Rice Noodles, Singapore Style Fried Vermicelli, Salad Rolls and rice.  This cost $80.23 in March, 2021.  The order was ready in exactly 20 minutes which is what they said we should expect. The restaurant has six or seven tables but none were in use when I arrived to pick up our order. We all agreed that it was a very satisfying meal. One disappointment was that the Satay Chicken was not spicy despite the word ""spicy"" next to it on the menu.  On the other hand the ginger beef was so flavourful that it might be among the best that I have tasted in recent memory.  My wife commented that she really liked the Saigon Vermicelli as it had a distinctive smokey flavour.  The salad rolls tasted as they should but they were wrapped very loosely, which is something that I've never encountered before. We couldn't eat them by hand.   Overall I would say that Saigon Cuisine was better than average. I wouldn't drive across the city to eat here but if you are in Edmonton's southwest it's a worthy choice.

My wife wanted to go get her car cleaned and our normal place on Airline was packed.  We googled searched car washes and decided to pay this place a visit.

When we arrive there were a few people vacuuming and detailing their cars, but no lines.

We decided to scrub the car first, to get the bugs off.  All the scrubbing areas were clean and has fresh soap and water.

Since it was Tuesday, it was $2 off any carwash.  We got the deluxe carwash which is normally $15.

The people there are very polite and helpful, and asked if we needed anything.

Once the car was washed, we headed to the vacuuming area.  Very clean with no trash around.  The vacuums were very powerful.  They also had air hoses to blow out dust from the dash or leaves from under your hood.

Overall, we had an excellent experience.

So, this week, I stopped by to ask a question.  It was sunny out.  I was alone.  Had my medical-grade mask in hand as I walked into the store from my car.  Only saw one person.  Some 20-30 something looking dude sitting at the register.  He was looking down, as though he was texting.  He barely managed enough energy to look up and the first thing he said was, ""You need to put your mask on . . ."" with, it seemed, no more regard in his voice than he would have shown to some homeless person who'd walked in asking for change.  
As I indicated, my mask was in my hand.  I started putting it on and, as I did so, I commented, ""Looks like you're the only one in here"".  I was about to follow that with, ""You must be lonely.  How has business been?""  But before I could take a breath, Mr. Charming says, derisively, ""It's the law.  You have to do it.""  What the hell is wrong with this punk?  Who the hell would want this kind of over-entitled jack ass working for them?  Who trained this idiot?  He barely let me finish my first statement, while I was putting on my mask, before he had to make himself feel better at my expense with his condescending and dismissive remark.  What the hell would possess this coward to behave that way?  He couldn't be bothered to stand up when I walked in.  He barely troubled himself to look up from whatever he was texting and the best he can do is be rude?  No ""Good afternoon"".  No ""How are you?"" Nothing.  Just rude.  I simply turned and on my way out explained to this cretin that I was just trying to talk with him.  I asked him why he would be so rude to me but received no response.  Again, his behavior suggested he wasn't interested in being troubled by someone coming in to the store. While this was happening, another person, an older female, appeared in an aisle from the other side of the store.  Not a word from her, either.  She didn't seem to care that someone was in the store.  No thanks, I.M.  I'm not going to brave the gauntlet of condescension and derision of your over-entitled staff just to give you more money.  Lots of people sell music equipment.  I wonder does the management at I.M. imagine I'm the only one the staff has treated this way?

_VGl0isVwzRJpMMwljoWIQ,4.0,"YUM!

One of the best Thai restaurants in Tampa. The food here is fantastic, and the owners really care about providing great food and a pleasant experience. That's not something you can fake.

For first timers, I would recommend the weekday lunch buffet. It's a great opportunity to experience new Thai foods without having to send dishes back, or waste your money. The selection is wide, varied and an extremely good value. One thing I appreciate is that the dishes are clearly and accurately labeled. That way you can remember what you like/dislike and order it again. We paid $11.25 per person, with a soft drink, which is a steal! 

The only downside I can see about this place is the parking is less than ideal. There are only a small number of small spaces in front, and a few more on the sides. Bring a small car if you can. I watched a Chevy Suburban engulf most of their parking lot singularly, but then a whole tribe of kids piled out which I guess counts as carpooling.  


If you catch them on their off-peak hours (just before 3 P.M. or before 11:30) or weekend days, you should do fine.",yum one of the best thai restaurants in tampa the food here is fantastic and the owners really care about providing great food and a pleasant experience thats not something you can fake for first timers i would recommend the weekday lunch buffet its a great opportunity to experience new thai foods without having to send dishes back or waste your money the selection is wide varied and an extremely good value one thing i appreciate is that the dishes are clearly and accurately labeled that way you can remember what you likedislike and order it again we paid per person with a soft drink which is a steal the only downside i can see about this place is the parking is less than ideal there are only a small number of small spaces in front and a few more on the sides bring a small car if you can i watched a chevy suburban engulf most of their parking lot singularly but then a whole tribe of kids piled out which i guess counts as carpooling if you catch them on their offpeak hours just before pm or before or weekend days you should do fine

Great. The table had the smoking whiskey (literally come's in a smoking box - pretentious but effective). French 75's/Cherry whiskey sour.

For food, my boyfriend ordered soup of the day, a curry and vegetable soup which was ok-tasting. It tasted somewhat artificial like it came out of a boxed curry powder. I got truffle parmesan fries which came in a very big portion for $6, but could be a little less cooked as some of it were quite overcooked and dry. I had to ask for some additional dipping sauce which it doesnt come with to finish it.

For main dish my boyfriend got the chicken fried chicken which was supposed to be their best selling dish at all times. Unfortunately he hated it, with the under-seasoned mac and cheese and a weird plum flavored mushroom and vegetable mix. My shrimp and grits on the other hand were quite tasty. The grits were creamy, and the shrimp were nicely seasoned and plump.

7vEtZGViU6H3n5FqbE19Hw,2.0,"After hitting up a few bridal shops to look at wedding gowns, I decided not to break the bank and to try looking at David's Bridal for something more affordable.  I made an appointment and the girls working were very friendly and helpful.  I just wish I had read some of these reviews before I went...

I made the mistake of giving them my phone number and email address.  This was a HUGE mistake, as apparently they sold my information.  I now get two to three phone calls from bridal telemarketers each day and countless emails from people and stores I have never heard of, offering me deals to get me to buy flowers, accessories, and photographers... you name it, I've gotten a phone call about it.  It is drives me crazy.  I even got a call from David's to remind me of another appointment, which I never even made.  I had to call and cancel the appointment they set up for me without my knowledge.  Small detail, but a pain in the butt when you've got a busy schedule.

On top of the spam I've been getting, the dresses I tried on weren't even worth the trouble.  I felt as if the fabric and stitching might tear apart quite easily.  It didn't seem as if the gowns were very well made, and the fabric felt uncomfortably cheap.  Granted, these were gowns under $1,000, so this is understandable and I won't fault the store too much for that (although I should note, I have found lower-priced dresses that are much, much better quality).  I also need to mention that while the sales associate helping me was nice, she made the experience incredibly awkward by staying in the tiny dressing room, waiting for me to undress, in order to help me into my gowns.  At every other bridal shop I have been to, the associates step out of the dressing room until you are ready to call them in for assistance.  This was just a comfort issue for me.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend David's Bridal to anyone unless you know what you're getting into, or they have the dress of your dreams.",after hitting up a few bridal shops to look at wedding gowns i decided not to break the bank and to try looking at davids bridal for something more affordable i made an appointment and the girls working were very friendly and helpful i just wish i had read some of these reviews before i went i made the mistake of giving them my phone number and email address this was a huge mistake as apparently they sold my information i now get two to three phone calls from bridal telemarketers each day and countless emails from people and stores i have never heard of offering me deals to get me to buy flowers accessories and photographers you name it ive gotten a phone call about it it is drives me crazy i even got a call from davids to remind me of another appointment which i never even made i had to call and cancel the appointment they set up for me without my knowledge small detail but a pain in the butt when youve got a busy schedule on top of the spam ive been getting the dresses i tried on werent even worth the trouble i felt as if the fabric and stitching might tear apart quite easily it didnt seem as if the gowns were very well made and the fabric felt uncomfortably cheap granted these were gowns under so this is understandable and i wont fault the store too much for that although i should note i have found lowerpriced dresses that are much much better quality i also need to mention that while the sales associate helping me was nice she made the experience incredibly awkward by staying in the tiny dressing room waiting for me to undress in order to help me into my gowns at every other bridal shop i have been to the associates step out of the dressing room until you are ready to call them in for assistance this was just a comfort issue for me overall i wouldnt recommend davids bridal to anyone unless you know what youre getting into or they have the dress of your dreams

The first night I had the Smokey Beef Short Ribs with Goat Milk Mashed Potatoes Roasted Carrots.

The short ribs were tender and juicy with a sweet sauce but the kicker was the carrots. I am guy that usually doesn't prefer vegetables and don't mind carrots but the carrots were amazing, roasting them gave it a nice sweet flavor that actually made me want to eat them.     

The second night we started off with the Green Chili Pork Nachos and those were one of the best nacho plates I have had, though don't order it alone because it is a for sure 2-3 person platter. The guacamole, tomatoes, and pork were all put together nicely. 
For the entree I ordered the bison burger which was also a pretty darn good meal. The burger was pretty good size and cooked perfectly it definitely made bison taste a heck of a lot better than some of the beef burgers. The side fries were not like normal greasy fast food fries, they were fries that were cooked with a spice that gave them a nice little kick that made them addictive to crave.    

At the end when the meal was over we still had some room for dessert, so we order the peach cobbler it was OUT OF THIS WORLD DELICIOUS! The cobbler and the peaches were cooked and warmed to perfection.

Just recently I decided to add two more speakers to my already four speaker set-up. I did a little research and spoke with one of the technicians who recommended sending my radio in for their flash and switch out the green band wires for no green band wires. Fast forward to receiving my radio and installing everything........ As I am installing the lower fairing speakers and amp wires I notice that my rear tour pak speakers do not have anywhere to plug into. I attempted to contact JM but it was after hours so I used the technical support email address and explained my issue. Within an hour or so I received a response addressing the issue. (Note this was all over the weekend). John immediately rectified my issue by sending out a new wiring harness.  Upon receiving the new harness I still had trouble hooking everything up. Again I used the technical support email and received a response saying someone will contact me first thing the next business day. I received that phone call and was walked through with my setup and have been blasting my 6 speaker set-up since. I was very pleased with the customer service and how professional the team was while handling my problem. Not having the right stuff the first time was definitely a bummer; however, mistakes/miscommunication are inevitable and things happen. Special recognition to John and the gentlemen who walked me through the wiring (I apologize for not remembering his name). Will continue to do business with JM ROKKER and recommend them to whoever wants the best for their scoot.

He was on a job and agreed to call me when he was done later that day to look at my issue. He called back a few hours later and was able to come the same afternoon to fix my outdoor faucet. 

He also took a look at my A/C, but ultimately realized it was an electrical issue.

While under my house he noticed a leak from the shower pan and took apart the drain to show me the issue. This was something that was supposed to be fixed for the original sale of the home and was never done. It's been a slow leak for five years now. 

As he walked back to his truck, he was thoughtful enough to pull in my garbage can. 

I'd definitely call Moseley's back for any future plumbing work.",zeph was friendly on the phone and in person he called back the same day i left a message he was on a job and agreed to call me when he was done later that day to look at my issue he called back a few hours later and was able to come the same afternoon to fix my outdoor faucet he also took a look at my ac but ultimately realized it was an electrical issue while under my house he noticed a leak from the shower pan and took apart the drain to show me the issue this was something that was supposed to be fixed for the original sale of the home and was never done its been a slow leak for five years now as he walked back to his truck he was thoughtful enough to pull in my garbage can id definitely call moseleys back for any future plumbing work

UnBs9SfFGQ7TpE_3uYIqfg,3.0,"This was my second visit to Charley's Steak House but it had been a few years since my last visit.  Honestly, I think my first visit was more enjoyable.  Maybe it was the fact that it was Valentines weekend and it was super packed but I didn't enjoy my meal as much.  

Our reservation was at 8:15 but we didn't get seated until about 8:50.  They kept bringing out huge platters of calamari to hold everyone over before they got seated since they were behind, which was very nice of them.  Once we finally got seated I ordered the cucumber spice for my cocktail.  I was confused when I got it because there was a lot of pineapple and no cucumbers in sight.  Then I realized that the waiter had brought me the pineapple spice margarita on accident, which was fine because I really enjoy spicy margaritas.

I was a little disappointed that we didn't get the presentation of the different meat cuts that first timers usually get since my boyfriend had never been to Charley's before.  I ordered the Valentine's special which was an 8 ounce filet over mashed potatoes with a side of scallops, I chose mine to be bacon wrapped.  My boyfriend got the new york strip and we got a side of potatoes au gratin.  It took about 45 minutes for our food to come out, which was understandable, but my meal was cold by the time I got it.  Not ice cold, but barely warm.  I was so hungry that I didn't want to wait even longer for another meal so I chose to eat it and not send it back.  Everything was good but nothing was great.  Although, my opinion may have been different if my meal was actually hot.  My boyfriends new york strip was very good and and potatoes au gratin were amazing!  For dessert we shared the creme brulee...SO good!

All in all I didn't enjoy this experience at Charley's as much as my last.  The fact that there are so many other steakhouses in Tampa, I'm not sure how soon I will return.  I only wish this experience was as good as my first.

So I finally go and sign the papers and shame on me, for not seeing until afterwards that I had fallen victim to the old bait and switch game.  My interest rate had mysteriously rose .08% above my loan rate that we had agreed upon.  I was given excuse after excuse as to why,  But never given a solid answer.  Wynn did absolutely nothing to correct this matter and pretty much told me it was my problem. True it is,  But after giving my business to them and my wifes, for 22 years they might try and resolve this immediately and timely, but no.  I picked up also on deceptive sales tactics as well, such as never really explaining my trade in value or breaking down the loan and a finance manager who pushed and pushed these totally useless warranties down my throat when I wouldn't purchase them.

Qc-rI1MgkfdslTVsdo_pIQ,5.0,"I loved working with Hem & Her! I'm so sad there aren't a million good reviews on Yelp about the quality of work they do. I bought my wedding dress at a boutique in Seattle, but needed a few alterations done here in Tucson. A friend recommended Hem & Her, so I thought I would give it a chance. 

The moment I walked in the door the owners were really friendly and ready to look at my dress even though I hadn't made an appointment. My dress had applique lace all over, needed to be taken in quite a bit, and needed fitting in the bust, so I knew the alterations would be a bit pricey and time consuming. Joyce- the owner and seamstress knew almost immediately how much it would be to alter the dress ($400), she fitted me with ease and speed, and told me it would be done in 6-7 weeks. I was surprised at her price (I had been quoted $600 in Seattle), and told her it was no problem if she needed to charge more, but she was positive it would only be $400! I paid right away, though I did have the option to pay half up front and the rest later. 

About 6 weeks later I went in to try on my dress, and Joyce had done an amazing job! She was able to lay the lace evenly and match up the areas she had to take out. She also added extra padding in the bust that fit me like a glove, I didn't have to worry about popping out of the dress the entire night of the wedding, and it didn't make me look like I had a push up bra on! I was so happy my friend told me to try Hem & Her, I never would have found it on my own.

It is, but above and beyond that they have an expertly crafted cocktail menu. The bartenders are amazing at what they do and the drinks are awesome. 

There is a bar area and a lounge area, complete with fireplace. In the adjacent room there is a popcorn machine that is self-serve so you can munch on some popcorn and drink the evening away. Although it was busy, it wasn't overly packed so the vibe was just right. The wait-staff was pretty attentive so we had what we needed. My only word of caution is that these drinks take a while to make so on a busy night the bartenders are very busy crafting the drinks.

EXCITED!  He invited my fiancée and I in for brunch (on the house) to sample their goods and we were sold! (The Challah French Toast - dare I say better than Sabrina's?!)

 Working with a small budget, Stephen worked within my limitations and with my Martha Stewart ideas.  Leading up to the event, Stephen was organized and helpful.

After shoulder relocation, xrays, two months of PT in Canada I was told my progress was poor and to get an MRI. My shoulder was frozen and mobility restricted. The wait for an MRI in Canada was 6 months. I called IMG and explained; an agent told me the MRI would be covered back in U.S. Came back to U.S., got initial assessment and referral for MRI, and IMG gave preapproval. I then underwent the imaging, more PT and doc assessments, eventually the verdict being surgery, which I opted against (for now, and relieved I did). Meanwhile, the U.S. docs billing dept. was dealing directly with IMG. It's now March (claims were received by IMG in December) and IMG has today refused to cover any of the medical bills accrued in the U.S. citing their policy that coverage does not extend to home country for injury sustained while abroad. And yet, they preapproved the MRI in the U.S. in writing and have been communicating with my U.S. doctors for months.

It comes with a hot or mild bbq sauce (I opted for the hot and stand by my decision) and the sauce definitely adds to the sandwich. I have to say me and my friend liked my sandwich more than the cheesesteak he got, I highly recommend it! 

There are also a large variety of sweets shops, including a chocolatier that is known for onion truffles, and another stall that has chocolate covered bacon! Needless to say it's a must see.

Only thing is a lot of the stalls close early, we arrived at about 3-4 and many were closing. If you intend on trying a lot of different stalls I recommend getting there early. Also, park farther away and walk, your chances of finding parking nearby are slim to none unless you want to pay an arm and a leg.",very cool venue there are a lot of options so theres something for everyone i got a boneless rib sandwich from the rib stand and it was delicious it comes with a hot or mild bbq sauce i opted for the hot and stand by my decision and the sauce definitely adds to the sandwich i have to say me and my friend liked my sandwich more than the cheesesteak he got i highly recommend it there are also a large variety of sweets shops including a chocolatier that is known for onion truffles and another stall that has chocolate covered bacon needless to say its a must see only thing is a lot of the stalls close early we arrived at about and many were closing if you intend on trying a lot of different stalls i recommend getting there early also park farther away and walk your chances of finding parking nearby are slim to none unless you want to pay an arm and a leg
MiPN-oUTmplbe9LTxDmkag,4.0,"After only two visits, I'm left questioning why it took me sooo long to try this place. I was under the impression this place was a glorified sandwich place, and since I'm not much of a sandwich connoisseur I always overlooked it. 

I finally took the time to check out the website after yelping ""lunch"" for the 15,000th time at work and seeing the same spots pop up (Newman's, Michael's, Sup etc). After browsing the offerings (salads, sandwiches, soups, pastas, burgers!) I was excited to try it. I met a friend and while the set up is a ""step up to the counter and place an order"" deal, they do bring the food to you. A major shout out to the fact they keep everything UPDATED, they post the daily specials on their website, and you can also call in and listen to them as well. The first visit I ordered a warm roast beef sandwich with sautéed peppers. I think I was thinking French dip, but this sandwich didn't need au jus at all and was literally filled with what seemed like an inch of tender, warm roast beef. My companion ordered the daily trio (soup, salad and grilled cheese sandwich), which also looked amazing. We both agreed, we were going to be back as the menu looked too good to not try more. 

My next visit, I ordered the lunch capellini and their split pea soup to-go. I used the phone extension and was able to run in and pick up my lunch in under 1 minute. I'm a seafood person, so the capellini could only be made better if shrimp was offered as an add-on (instead of only chicken). The split pea was delicious, and I'm not lying, it's a healthy soup with real soup flavor. 

Bottom line is if you are a working type, and want a delicious, and flavorful lunch instead of the tired, boring same old offerings, you need to come in here. 

Beware, there is a little bit higher  price point, but it is worth it in my opinion. Also one last demerit, is the fact you can't sub soup for a lunch sandwich side, even with an upcharge (just chips or potato salad).",after only two visits im left questioning why it took me sooo long to try this place i was under the impression this place was a glorified sandwich place and since im not much of a sandwich connoisseur i always overlooked it i finally took the time to check out the website after yelping lunch for the th time at work and seeing the same spots pop up newmans michaels sup etc after browsing the offerings salads sandwiches soups pastas burgers i was excited to try it i met a friend and while the set up is a step up to the counter and place an order deal they do bring the food to you a major shout out to the fact they keep everything updated they post the daily specials on their website and you can also call in and listen to them as well the first visit i ordered a warm roast beef sandwich with sauted peppers i think i was thinking french dip but this sandwich didnt need au jus at all and was literally filled with what seemed like an inch of tender warm roast beef my companion ordered the daily trio soup salad and grilled cheese sandwich which also looked amazing we both agreed we were going to be back as the menu looked too good to not try more my next visit i ordered the lunch capellini and their split pea soup togo i used the phone extension and was able to run in and pick up my lunch in under minute im a seafood person so the capellini could only be made better if shrimp was offered as an addon instead of only chicken the split pea was delicious and im not lying its a healthy soup with real soup flavor bottom line is if you are a working type and want a delicious and flavorful lunch instead of the tired boring same old offerings you need to come in here beware there is a little bit higher price point but it is worth it in my opinion also one last demerit is the fact you cant sub soup for a lunch sandwich side even with an upcharge just chips or potato salad

ZpXZgnBrNodHH8pKpOK_Kg,4.0,"A friend and I decided to go to dinner. I was interested in having a steak and he suggested Jesse's. He characterized the restaurant as being a place that has very good service and food at a reasonable price. 

I was not thrilled with the idea of driving 30 minutes into the horrible traffic surrounding the Brandon Mall area. However, I agreed to give it a try and I am very happy that I did. In fact, had the ambiance of the restaurant been more appealing I would have been tempted to rate it a 10 (which if you follow my reviews you would note that I have rarely, if ever, rated a restaurant a 10).

The restaurant does not look like much from the outside and the interior is not impressive either. As you enter the building the room is fairly dark. There is a bar on the right side and about 12 or so four tops on the left. Passing through the room you will enter another that is brighter, but very narrow. 

We were seated promptly and greeted warmly by our server. My friend and I both ordered the crab soup and the Delmonico steak with a baked potato. The meal came with bread and a side salad.The bread was warm and fresh. The side salad also was fresh and very good. The crab soup was served hot and was delicious. However, if I were to order it again I would not have it topped with melted cheese (which is optional). Now to the steak! It was excellent. It was very tender and tasted great! I ordered the 16oz portion and I swear it was 18-20 oz!

He let me try it without any sauce and then with. Gotta say it was all pretty amazing and I'll definitely be going back. I am no bbq pro but I have tried many different places in a few states and it was as good as any I've had. For comparison locally, I've been to Jazzys(and a couple others) and was very unimpressed but I know everyone has their preference. 
I ended up going with the beef brisket and a side of cole slaw. The beef had just enough fat to really give it a great flavor(I personally prefer some), which I would have been fine with bare or with sauce. It was juicy, had a nice oak flavor, and cooked to the right consistancy. I like that the sauce was put on the side because i actually ate half of the beef plain and half with sauce. I really enjoyed the sauce as well, tangy, just enough spice, and i believe vinegar based(?), which is how I prefer it.

tXf6TpqHOLiwyMNbYAOOCQ,4.0,"Good Dining in a Strip Center

Five of us shared a lot of different menu items and, overall, it was very good.  The restaurant is small and fills up quickly.  The kitchen is right behind the bar.  Service is friendly and helpful.

This gastropub is beer and wine only and the selections are relatively good value.

For appetizers we started with the wonderful char siu pork ribs.  Then we moved on to the deviled eggs which were fine but the various individual elements didn't really come together.  Deviled egg capped with a piece of fried chicken thigh topped with some salmon roe didn't really work.  Much better deviled eggs at Z Grill in St Pete.  We also had an order of poutine.  The fries, served in a narrow basket, were good, but the gravy was only OK and the cheese curds were in large clumps that all melted into a bit of gooey mess.  It would have been better with the fries on an open bowl and, a better gravy, and crumbled cheese curds.

For entrees we had the fish special which was swordfish.  It was nicely cooked and the chimichurri sauce with it was delicious.  The short rib and the lamb shank were both quite nice and very heavy.  Very good was the farro risotto which was drier than a typical risotto and had a delightful nutty flavor.

For dessert we shared the pecan pie which was nice and the smore tart which was rich and delicious.

I had hoped that a few more things would be a home run like the pork rib appetizer.

Our server was professional and knowledgeable, and we had a pretty fantastic meal. My only quibble is that the bartender was unfamiliar with the sazerac, and had neither rye whiskey nor absinthe.  What is this, the 20th century?  I guess 21st century (i.e. 19th century) mixology hasn't made it to Philly.  Anyway, the manhattan I wound up with was perfectly fine. 
I had the NY strip steak, with horseradish cream (which was just as I like it -- more horseradish than cream) with a side of asparagus. It arrived at the perfect time when I had finished my drink and was ready for a glass of the nebbiolo, which was a fantastic complement (if I do say so myself) to the magnificent steak. The asparagus was perhaps too tarted up. I did like that they had mixed in some Spargel-esque white asparagus, but the goopy sauce and sauteed onions didn't do it for me -- asparagus should be simple.

They loose a star for all the plastic, though.  Absolutely everything (plastic forks, cups, sauces, etc.) is served in cheap flimsy plastic.  It gives the experience a very fast-food feeling.  Perhaps it's meant as a war on the evil environment or just plain laziness, but in any case, they should at least upgrade to the stronger stuff that don't bend and break while you're eating.",grew up eating here on weekends but this was my first time back in over years the place looks great modern but still original and with a much better selection of beers than the old budbushmiller lite days the fish and the sides are still great they loose a star for all the plastic though absolutely everything plastic forks cups sauces etc is served in cheap flimsy plastic it gives the experience a very fastfood feeling perhaps its meant as a war on the evil environment or just plain laziness but in any case they should at least upgrade to the stronger stuff that dont bend and break while youre eating
0OsR9lO16jxa0xWUY57s9g,5.0,"I'll echo what other reviewers have said--Koto is a hidden gem in Philadelphia... great food and service, BYOB, and reasonably priced.

I made an 8:15 pm New Year's Eve reservation here through OpenTable for myself, my boyfriend, and a friend. When we arrived, the restaurant had only three other tables filled, and was clean, quiet, and comfortable. We ordered three rolls to split ($6 each): Philadelphia roll, spicy tuna, and yellowtail scallion. The Philadelphia and spicy tuna rolls were excellent... the yellowtail lacked flavor but that happens every once in a while and wouldn't stop me from ordering it again. We then ordered Hibachi dinners (two chicken -- $17 each, one steak -- $19). I was excited because this is one of the only Hibachi restaurants I've been to that carries gluten free soy sauce! The meat, veggies, and two complimentary shrimp were really good. My only complaint is that the Hibachi dinner default comes with steamed white rice, and they charge an additional $3 to upgrade to the classic Hibachi fried rice... annoying, but worth it.

Our waitress was sweet and attentive, and the chef came out at the end of the meal to check on us and offer a Japanese soda on the house.

PVsCyqjkAn-0VQRPUH0IxQ,1.0,"I highly advise everyone I know to NEVER BUY A CAR OR GET REPAIR WORK DONE AT Ed Martin Buick GMC. My car is now back in their shop for the 4th time in 3 weeks for this same issue. I've paid more than $700 in repairs and they still can not figure out what the burning smell is coming from.They've had it since Saturday, which is  when I took it back in (for the third time) because there was visible oil leaking on other parts under the hood. **PICTURED BELOW* I was assured that the issue is fixed this time. Today, they actually drove my car out to my job completely across town to deliver it with the SAME burning smell that I took it in for. I smelled it immediately when I opened the door and also when I opened the hood. I even had a coworker come outside to confirm the smell. He smelled it immediately too and said it was coming from the vents. I then found where it looks like the front bumper isn't even flush with the rest of the car and looks like its been messed with. I refused to accept the car back and sent it back with him because it was still not fixed. How do you have a car for 6 days (for the third time) and still can't figure it out??  I even allowed them to drive the car home for two days to make sure any residual oil was burned off before they gave it back to me because that was there excuse for the lingering smell the past two times. 

So I called their GM, Zach, who I met with on Saturday and he tried pushing me off to Cathy, their service manager, again. On Saturday I asked him to come outside and see the work his people did on my car. He said ""Well I wouldn't be able to tell if it's right or wrong either way, so you just need to talk with Cathy."" Ummmmm....How does someone with no knowledge of cars become the General Manager of Ed Martin Buick GMC ???? I have no knowledge of cars but I can sure tell that oil leaking on other parts and a jimmy rigged heat shield is not quality work. So after getting off the phone with Zach, who was not one ounce of help, I called back and asked their WITCHY operator, Jackie, for the name of whoever owns the dealership. She argued with me for a moment, then informed me that Mark Harrison is the COO, proceeded to rattle off the address to the  Ed Martin Acura store and then she HUNG UP ON ME immediately. I called back and she said ""what do you need!?"" EXCUSE ME?????????? That is probably the worst way she could've handled the call. Again, TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE

 I have really kept a cool head about this, been polite and haven't gotten shitty with any of them until today. I've given them the opportunity THREE times now to fix their shotty work because I truly believed that it was better to pay a little more to have it repaired at the dealership where they are supposed to have top notch mechanics than to take it somewhere else. Never Again. 

Here I am, still without my car or any answers, and I've wasted $700 on worthless repairs. Obviously me writing this is not going to fix my car or reimburse me for the money that was wasted. I'm simply writing this to warn family and friends to save you the time, hassle and money of buying a car from Ed Martin Buick GMC or having repairs made by their shop that cant even correctly diagnose and fix a car after three tries. I think they see a single mother that doesn't know much about cars and they assume they can take advantage of the situation. Well they are wrong. Honestly, I don't know what to do at this point but I'm determined to get this fixed CORRECTLY and warn others, even if that means I have to stand on the sidewalk on Michigan Road outside of the Ed Martin Buick GMC dealership with a huge sign to warn people of their inability to fix a car.",i highly advise everyone i know to never buy a car or get repair work done at ed martin buick gmc my car is now back in their shop for the th time in weeks for this same issue ive paid more than in repairs and they still can not figure out what the burning smell is coming fromtheyve had it since saturday which is when i took it back in for the third time because there was visible oil leaking on other parts under the hood pictured below i was assured that the issue is fixed this time today they actually drove my car out to my job completely across town to deliver it with the same burning smell that i took it in for i smelled it immediately when i opened the door and also when i opened the hood i even had a coworker come outside to confirm the smell he smelled it immediately too and said it was coming from the vents i then found where it looks like the front bumper isnt even flush with the rest of the car and looks like its been messed with i refused to accept the car back and sent it back with him because it was still not fixed how do you have a car for days for the third time and still cant figure it out i even allowed them to drive the car home for two days to make sure any residual oil was burned off before they gave it back to me because that was there excuse for the lingering smell the past two times so i called their gm zach who i met with on saturday and he tried pushing me off to cathy their service manager again on saturday i asked him to come outside and see the work his people did on my car he said well i wouldnt be able to tell if its right or wrong either way so you just need to talk with cathy ummmmmhow does someone with no knowledge of cars become the general manager of ed martin buick gmc i have no knowledge of cars but i can sure tell that oil leaking on other parts and a jimmy rigged heat shield is not quality work so after getting off the phone with zach who was not one ounce of help i called back and asked their witchy operator jackie for the name of whoever owns the dealership she argued with me for a moment then informed me that mark harrison is the coo proceeded to rattle off the address to the ed martin acura store and then she hung up on me immediately i called back and she said what do you need excuse me that is probably the worst way she couldve handled the call again terrible customer service i have really kept a cool head about this been polite and havent gotten shitty with any of them until today ive given them the opportunity three times now to fix their shotty work because i truly believed that it was better to pay a little more to have it repaired at the dealership where they are supposed to have top notch mechanics than to take it somewhere else never again here i am still without my car or any answers and ive wasted on worthless repairs obviously me writing this is not going to fix my car or reimburse me for the money that was wasted im simply writing this to warn family and friends to save you the time hassle and money of buying a car from ed martin buick gmc or having repairs made by their shop that cant even correctly diagnose and fix a car after three tries i think they see a single mother that doesnt know much about cars and they assume they can take advantage of the situation well they are wrong honestly i dont know what to do at this point but im determined to get this fixed correctly and warn others even if that means i have to stand on the sidewalk on michigan road outside of the ed martin buick gmc dealership with a huge sign to warn people of their inability to fix a car

This was the worst Chinese/Asian food I've ever had. I've had Chinese food at some real bad places in Philly, think Temple Star or China Bowl near Temple University - and this place /still/ managed to fall below. 

But that's not even a fair comparison because Mian charges 16.95 for all of their dishes, including simple ones like General Tsos.

Once you provide Terrell with your name and phone number you will sit and wait, and wait, and wait, and wait, and wait- again even if you are the only one in the store  you will wait no less than 10 minutes maybe 20.

ag7uLN-vxVh3IL7xHdPoDQ,1.0,"First off it's Nikola K. NOT Nikola R. 
Secondly this is not a fake review, I solely created this Yelp account to leave a review because the service was so bad, this was my first ever Yelp review. Let me remind you, the service was so bad that I created a yell just to leave a review. Also, it's very unfortunate an employee was fired regarding this, this was never my intent and if you are the employee reading this I recommend you get a lawyer and appeal your employment at this place, not because this is a place you should work but because Robert had no right to fire you. I believe this employee deserves to be legally compensated for being fired over a synthetic reason Robert created as an excuse for breaking my phone. It's just disgusting Robert would go out of his way to punish an employee by firing them vs taking ownership and responsibility. Absolutely pathetic!

After I reached out about my concert Robert went OFF on me via phone call and claimed that I knew the individual who serviced me and alleged we worked together to steal from him, such a pathetic excuse to fix a problem. I promise I don't know the employee. I don't think Robert thinks I actually knew the employee but I think it was just another excuse, if he does actually think I knew the employee than it's comical and I question his how he came to this conclusion. In my opinion Robert should have approached this issue differently and worked with me as a customer rather than against me. 

Weeks later after this incident I was a victim of identity theft, several of my finance accounts were hacked. I was able to pinpoint it back to Robert because at the time I took my phone there this particular information was on the device at that time, I found out the accounts were used to purchase Bitcoin and an investigator was able to find that the accounts were also used to buy cellphone parts from China and Afghanistan, similar to the ones used at Uzoox. So although I cannot 100% say Robert was the one responsible for this because he wasn't caught red handed but if I had to take an educated guess based off pure facts and commonalities I would say he was behind it or associated with it. I was also able to find out Robert doesn't have the cleanest record and is by no means what I would call a role model citizen.

Moral of the story is you should take note of my review and really consider Roberts business ethics and self character. Robert doesn't care about you the customer, he only cares about himself and most importantly the profit made. Oh, by the way he pays $5-15 for his iPhone replacement screens, so you do the math for the profit. There's many other places that offer better services at better prices than Robert, it's not worth getting your data searched through and putting your information at risk + it's not worth dealing with Robert because he's a pain in the a**. You and your wallet will regret doing business here, trust me. Also, don't let the good reviews fool you. Robert incentives customers to leave good reviews by offering them discounts. 

P.S. I don't have personality deficiency, how immature for you to attack my character and make a false claim. Shame on you! The review isn't fake, and the reason it was updated two years later is because I went to go leave another bad review for another business over a bad experience. While doing this I was going through my profile and saw an old review, my only other review. I felt obligated to update it and remind people about your bad and unethical business practices to attempt to save them from headache and throwing away money. Your mistake cost me over $1,000, your companies mistake wasn't forgotten over the time so I felt it was only right to update, and remind. I only use Yelp to leave bad reviews, which is rare so for me to go out of my way to leave a review for Yelp a company really has to be in the wrong. But the difference between you and the other company I recently left a bad review for is they took responsibility and were understanding. They apologized and fixed the issue you, so I deleted the review because it was no longer relevant since they fixed the issue. Robert, you should learn from great businesses like the one that took full responsibility to address and fix the issue and most importantly work toward become a better citizen.",first off its nikola k not nikola r secondly this is not a fake review i solely created this yelp account to leave a review because the service was so bad this was my first ever yelp review let me remind you the service was so bad that i created a yell just to leave a review also its very unfortunate an employee was fired regarding this this was never my intent and if you are the employee reading this i recommend you get a lawyer and appeal your employment at this place not because this is a place you should work but because robert had no right to fire you i believe this employee deserves to be legally compensated for being fired over a synthetic reason robert created as an excuse for breaking my phone its just disgusting robert would go out of his way to punish an employee by firing them vs taking ownership and responsibility absolutely pathetic after i reached out about my concert robert went off on me via phone call and claimed that i knew the individual who serviced me and alleged we worked together to steal from him such a pathetic excuse to fix a problem i promise i dont know the employee i dont think robert thinks i actually knew the employee but i think it was just another excuse if he does actually think i knew the employee than its comical and i question his how he came to this conclusion in my opinion robert should have approached this issue differently and worked with me as a customer rather than against me weeks later after this incident i was a victim of identity theft several of my finance accounts were hacked i was able to pinpoint it back to robert because at the time i took my phone there this particular information was on the device at that time i found out the accounts were used to purchase bitcoin and an investigator was able to find that the accounts were also used to buy cellphone parts from china and afghanistan similar to the ones used at uzoox so although i cannot say robert was the one responsible for this because he wasnt caught red handed but if i had to take an educated guess based off pure facts and commonalities i would say he was behind it or associated with it i was also able to find out robert doesnt have the cleanest record and is by no means what i would call a role model citizen moral of the story is you should take note of my review and really consider roberts business ethics and self character robert doesnt care about you the customer he only cares about himself and most importantly the profit made oh by the way he pays for his iphone replacement screens so you do the math for the profit theres many other places that offer better services at better prices than robert its not worth getting your data searched through and putting your information at risk its not worth dealing with robert because hes a pain in the a you and your wallet will regret doing business here trust me also dont let the good reviews fool you robert incentives customers to leave good reviews by offering them discounts ps i dont have personality deficiency how immature for you to attack my character and make a false claim shame on you the review isnt fake and the reason it was updated two years later is because i went to go leave another bad review for another business over a bad experience while doing this i was going through my profile and saw an old review my only other review i felt obligated to update it and remind people about your bad and unethical business practices to attempt to save them from headache and throwing away money your mistake cost me over your companies mistake wasnt forgotten over the time so i felt it was only right to update and remind i only use yelp to leave bad reviews which is rare so for me to go out of my way to leave a review for yelp a company really has to be in the wrong but the difference between you and the other company i recently left a bad review for is they took responsibility and were understanding they apologized and fixed the issue you so i deleted the review because it was no longer relevant since they fixed the issue robert you should learn from great businesses like the one that took full responsibility to address and fix the issue and most importantly work toward become a better citizen

We arrived at our gate just early enough that we had enough time to grab a sandwich.

It had a four different types of meat and read similar to a Italian.  There was no line so I had my toasted sandwich in just a few minutes.  I also received particularly good service, topped by a wonderful smile by my cashier.

They have no seating so I took my food back to our gate to enjoy.  It was not a very large sandwich and as you can see by the photo didn't look like much, but it was tasty.

I didn't choose this company, my insurance company did it. They show up at my body shop parking spot with running car and all of the windows was rolling down. AC was running in full.

On my way back home I start smell weed in the car. It was very weird and I was thinking maybe it is from their car that driving next to me. The car stays outside for the whole day, at the evening me and my family decided to go grab some ice cream. When we did open the car door the smell was so strong that everybody was like - Uhhh! This is disgusting. 
I am allergic and asthmatic, I cannot stand this smell. I feel myself very very sick when I smell Marijuana. It was too late to return the car so I did it at the next day morning. The person in their enterprise was acting like he cannot smoke anything. But the smell was so strong that I should drive all the way back to the location with the open windows. As I know it's illegal to smoke marijuana when you're driving and especially in the rent car. 
I could not imagine what people can think about me or a police officer if he decides to pull me out... that I am a drug user?! So this car rent not only hurt my feeling, ruin my family evening,  my next day work, and make me a looks like I am a drug user... but they hurt my health and well-being!
After all, they charge me around $50 for the one day of driving in this stinky car, from my body shop, to scan my credit card in their location, to my way back home, and back to them.

When she made it to our table (mind you there were only 3 tables occupied in the entire restaurant) she dropped app plates, silverware and napkins at our table and just walked away.

Went there today (west of Home Depot parking lot) and delighted to find him there! He had that same gracious and welcoming smile- ultimate hospitality. I ordered exactly what I had ordered at the Food Truck and I was not disappointed. And the price is right too! My Bahn Mi arrived, and although one sandwich, cut into two looks like a 'for two' portion, here's the secret to eating it all, without feeling stuffed. The magic is in the bread. Until now, my favorite baguette in Tucson is found at Roma......and served at Gavi's....as close to a Parisian baguette as you can get.........Vina's baguette it airlight....and full of flavor. Don't try to customize the sandwich....(even if head cheese sounds odd), just take it as it is made....you won't be disappointed.......and to top if off....Lin put down a sauce shaker which said ""soy sauce"", however it's not the brown salty stuff we think of, it's the ""umami"" that brings all the flavors together- it's a light sweet/salty/vinegar type sauce.......just a little makes all the ingredients come together.....I also had a Thai iced tea......if you are a fan of Boba teas...then it will take you a while to chose you flavor. I'll be back soon to try the Pad Thai.......so far Char Thai has my favorite in Tucson.

Maybe I'm fussy as I work at a movie theater myself, we weren't showing the film though so here I was.

The projection was skewed to the left a few inches. Which, whatever, not the biggest issue. A manageable fix though. 

But then the lights came up about 40 minutes from the end of the movie? My boyfriend stepped out just to ask someone to turn them back down, but the staffer he spoke to had trouble finding the manager. After little effort looking the staffer just came back and shrugged ""that happens""... which it shouldn't, and that should not be the attitude about it as it is a quick fix? Just turn the dang lights back down. Which no one ever did. It washed out the picture and was distracting. 


When we spoke to the manager after the film he did patiently listen to my complaints, and upon my request gave me a refund. But in a day and age where most people can sit at home and watch a movie, you would think they would try to give you an experience that gets you off the couch?

R46XVcmUzy8qeerHyZQtEg,2.0,"Grilled cheese as ""art form""? ""Comfort food on steroids""? Please.

This is another place whose apparent popularity mystifies me. (And I swear I don't write this sort of thing just to be contrary.)

Each of the three times I've visited - hoping every time to experience what many others seem to genuinely enjoy - the food has been mediocre at best and (in the case of their tomato soup) downright inedible.

About those grilled cheeses: They're big! That's pretty much the most positive thing I can say about them. The bread is spongy, oversized ""Texas toast""-style and seems less grilled than toasted to me. And the cheese, applied with too generous a hand (yes, it is possible to have too much cheese in a sandwich) has been lukewarm and congealed two times I've eaten there and literally cold and unmelted in places the third, and last. You can make much better grilled cheese sandwiches at home, and probably have.

And about that tomato soup: Think ketchup thinned out with water, or plain old Campbells made with 2 1/2 soup cans of water instead of one, and you'll get an idea of what I experienced the last time I ate there. And that too was served lukewarm.

The sweet potato fries were OK. I'll give them that.

So yeah, I don't get where all the raves are coming from - unless it's another case where people are too charmed by a silly New Orleans pun in the name of the establishment to care whether the food is truly good or not.",grilled cheese as art form comfort food on steroids please this is another place whose apparent popularity mystifies me and i swear i dont write this sort of thing just to be contrary each of the three times ive visited hoping every time to experience what many others seem to genuinely enjoy the food has been mediocre at best and in the case of their tomato soup downright inedible about those grilled cheeses theyre big thats pretty much the most positive thing i can say about them the bread is spongy oversized texas toaststyle and seems less grilled than toasted to me and the cheese applied with too generous a hand yes it is possible to have too much cheese in a sandwich has been lukewarm and congealed two times ive eaten there and literally cold and unmelted in places the third and last you can make much better grilled cheese sandwiches at home and probably have and about that tomato soup think ketchup thinned out with water or plain old campbells made with soup cans of water instead of one and youll get an idea of what i experienced the last time i ate there and that too was served lukewarm the sweet potato fries were ok ill give them that so yeah i dont get where all the raves are coming from unless its another case where people are too charmed by a silly new orleans pun in the name of the establishment to care whether the food is truly good or not
CQjuS4uwiQV5SZ491vna1Q,5.0,"GoldLeaf is a welcoming, excellent addition to our South Broad Ripple/Fairgrounds/etc. neighborhood. Although they opened in the middle of COVID, they appear to be doing well, thanks to their friendly owners & staff, creative and quality menu options that incorporate local products, and investment in the neighborhood. Plus, any place that offers Underbergs is A+ in my estimation. The baked goods and pastry options always look and taste great too, according to my pastry buff partner.  I like grabbing an Old Major truffle beef stick on my visits, for a lower carb snack, and hope to check out the chicken salad over arugula lunch option in the near future.    Once COVID dies down, we're interested in exploring GoldLeaf's beer/alcohol options once they feel comfortable re-opening their bar-top and expanding their hours.  GoldLeaf also partners with other 46th Street businesses, such as collaborating with Black Circle Brewing over a ""Stay Gold"" lager offering.

I also really enjoy GoldLeaf because my partner is a Phish-obsessive and jam band uber-fan, and the congenial owners tend to incorporate musical references into the naming of GoldLeaf's specials/options. He loves the hidden references and I get a chuckle out of observing the habits and conversations of the not-so-secret society of Phish fans whenever we visit GoldLeaf (i.e. the explanation behind the ""Nutty Wook"" dirty chai latte ).  The owners and staff are just amazingly nice, that you may personally get ""please be my friend"" feelings whenever you visit.  I highly recommend visiting GoldLeaf so you can enjoy its special and welcoming qualities.",goldleaf is a welcoming excellent addition to our south broad ripplefairgroundsetc neighborhood although they opened in the middle of covid they appear to be doing well thanks to their friendly owners staff creative and quality menu options that incorporate local products and investment in the neighborhood plus any place that offers underbergs is a in my estimation the baked goods and pastry options always look and taste great too according to my pastry buff partner i like grabbing an old major truffle beef stick on my visits for a lower carb snack and hope to check out the chicken salad over arugula lunch option in the near future once covid dies down were interested in exploring goldleafs beeralcohol options once they feel comfortable reopening their bartop and expanding their hours goldleaf also partners with other th street businesses such as collaborating with black circle brewing over a stay gold lager offering i also really enjoy goldleaf because my partner is a phishobsessive and jam band uberfan and the congenial owners tend to incorporate musical references into the naming of goldleafs specialsoptions he loves the hidden references and i get a chuckle out of observing the habits and conversations of the notsosecret society of phish fans whenever we visit goldleaf ie the explanation behind the nutty wook dirty chai latte the owners and staff are just amazingly nice that you may personally get please be my friend feelings whenever you visit i highly recommend visiting goldleaf so you can enjoy its special and welcoming qualities

eFtQDmNER9pRB9YdPxMMXA,2.0,"I am also from California, SF area, and I totally sympathize with the last posting in that I have yet to find a Chinese restaurant in the New Orleans area that doesn't make me feel like crap.
Jung's is unfortunately included.

The question is why I even gave two stars after how I felt afterward:
Cool ambiance, appropriately decorated I guess.
Fast service and great attention to our table, including drink refills.
The hostess was great.

And so why only two stars? 
1st twilight zone moment- Aren't Chinese restaurants supposed to give you a pot of green tea?
2nd- I asked what kind of sauce was in the Chicken and Broccoli dish. Apparently, it's brown sauce. Um, like brown garlic sauce (...I'm thinking of that simple Thai dish back in SF...)? No, just brown sauce. I couldn't get her to tell me how the sauce got from clear to brown. I took my chances, and it was actually OK. I just wish I knew what was in it. And I kinda needed to, because I'm allergic to fish, including fish sauces. Like peanut sauce, which is also brown.
3rd- Next question was if the spring roll that came with my combo had fish in it. Yes. Then I told her about my allergy. Ok, can I substitute for a veggie spring roll? No. Ridiculous. What do vegetarians do? So I ordered an extra VEGGIE roll side, story to be continued...
4th- My roommate ordered sweet and sour chicken. And got sweet and sour fish. 
5th- I wondered if it was the ""brown"" sauce or the roll that gave me the reaction 30 minutes after leaving the restaurant. My leftovers proved that the VEGGIE roll had fish in it, which I took apart and fed to my cat.
6th- Just because it's Chinese food doesn't make each part of a meal automatically cost about $8.00-11.50. 

I usually don't post, and I am empathetic and really want to be fair about my posts.
So I can understand if the waitress has trouble with English, or like the chef had a bad day, or something. 
But I basically was poisoned. I did everything I could to avoid getting poisoned, and I still got poisoned.

I don't appreciate the dog policy.  It would be ok if they had a no dog policy that everyone adhered to or if they didn't tell us a lame (and not true) story about why they can't allow pets.  Many restaurants don't allow pets and we just eat elsewhere.

What I don't appreciate is one staff member telling me that we are welcome at certain tables but then having to endure an entire meal with other staff members dropping by to tell us that we aren't actually welcome.  If we aren't welcome in any seat then why did someone tell me that we could sit down in this one?

I also don't appreciate people lying to me.  Don't tell me it is CA state law that pets can't eat on patios.  I've reviewed the law.  I know that isn't true.  When confronted with the truth a nice lady at Jeannine's tried to tell me that the CA state law is special to Jeannine's because they had a law suit.  Someone else told me (during the same meal) that it was because a dog ran into the street while attached to a table and caused damage to the patio as well as being killed after running into the street.  (Pathetic lie.)

King Kong was interesting but very sweet. My favorite was the vanilla cream - simple but delicious.

Rb9QIj-NyRn_giOBN991YA,2.0,"""I'm full, but I'm disappointed"" those were the first words out of my boyfriend's mouth as we got in our car. The service is fine, you do bus your own table which is not a bad thing, but your food needs to back it up. I had been wanted to try this place for quite some time, as biscuits and gravy are one of my all time favorite things, so I was stoked when I finally got the chance. The food looks amazing, but that's where it stops. We had the Reggie, Shrimp and grits, biscuits and gravy, and fried green tomatoes. We always try to give all restaurants a fair shot. The shrimp and grits were the best tasting thing we had, but the grits were clumpy and watery, it was a really weird texture. The actual biscuits are yummy. Airy, buttery and flavorful, everything you hope for in a biscuit. The Reggie was just ok, but again lacking in any clear flavor. There was no star, just a bland sandwich. The fried tomatoes we're good, but it's pretty hard to mess those up. Both gravies were a total miss for me. They tasted strongly of flour and really lacking in seasoning, other than adding spicy components to it. You can't just make something spicy and expect it to be good. Balance is everything and there was no balance to anything we had. The inside is nice enough, and the staff is nice, but this was a total miss for us. Food is an adventure and when it's good, it stirs up something in your soul. Unfortunately I just ended up full of disappointment.",im full but im disappointed those were the first words out of my boyfriends mouth as we got in our car the service is fine you do bus your own table which is not a bad thing but your food needs to back it up i had been wanted to try this place for quite some time as biscuits and gravy are one of my all time favorite things so i was stoked when i finally got the chance the food looks amazing but thats where it stops we had the reggie shrimp and grits biscuits and gravy and fried green tomatoes we always try to give all restaurants a fair shot the shrimp and grits were the best tasting thing we had but the grits were clumpy and watery it was a really weird texture the actual biscuits are yummy airy buttery and flavorful everything you hope for in a biscuit the reggie was just ok but again lacking in any clear flavor there was no star just a bland sandwich the fried tomatoes were good but its pretty hard to mess those up both gravies were a total miss for me they tasted strongly of flour and really lacking in seasoning other than adding spicy components to it you cant just make something spicy and expect it to be good balance is everything and there was no balance to anything we had the inside is nice enough and the staff is nice but this was a total miss for us food is an adventure and when its good it stirs up something in your soul unfortunately i just ended up full of disappointment

G3w7XlKj1kf_5ddg4Faxpw,1.0,"They say everything is cheaper in the Midwest, but that is untrue. Here you pay $19.50 for bottomless mimosas. I'll admit I'm spoiled in Texas where there are bottomless mimosas for $12-15, but this seemed expensive. Additionally, here they put ice in the mimosas. Unfortunately the mimosas were the best part.

The service was pretty awful. We arrived (as a group of 8) around 12PM and it was not packed. We sat down quickly, but waited about 15 minutes for a waiter to come by and ask for drink orders or even water. In fact, I had to ask for a waiter to come over. 

When we ordered food, the waitress told one of my friends it was slow and food should come quickly. When I ordered and wanted sausage in my omelette instead of chicken, she said it was so busy she didn't want to ask the chefs to make modifications. So I dealt with it. Our food arrived not at once but piecemeal. Some of the orders were wrong. I had ordered an omelette and donut holes, and I had to remind the waitress about the donut holes when they hadn't arrived after 30 minutes of waiting and having eaten my meal already. 

As for food, the omelette was OK. It's hard to mess up eggs, but there was nothing special about it. The donut holes are mainly air and deflate immediately upon first contact with teeth. Perhaps it's personal preference, but I prefer my donuts fluffy and full of flour.  

The waitress knew the service was bad and brought us a ""free"" bottle of champagne to try and make up for it. Sadly Wycliff just doesn't make up for awful service. We also never saw her again after that until we asked for the check.

They did have Cholula hot sauce available, which was a win. However, unless you're desperate for food, I recommend trying another spot for brunch.",they say everything is cheaper in the midwest but that is untrue here you pay for bottomless mimosas ill admit im spoiled in texas where there are bottomless mimosas for but this seemed expensive additionally here they put ice in the mimosas unfortunately the mimosas were the best part the service was pretty awful we arrived as a group of around pm and it was not packed we sat down quickly but waited about minutes for a waiter to come by and ask for drink orders or even water in fact i had to ask for a waiter to come over when we ordered food the waitress told one of my friends it was slow and food should come quickly when i ordered and wanted sausage in my omelette instead of chicken she said it was so busy she didnt want to ask the chefs to make modifications so i dealt with it our food arrived not at once but piecemeal some of the orders were wrong i had ordered an omelette and donut holes and i had to remind the waitress about the donut holes when they hadnt arrived after minutes of waiting and having eaten my meal already as for food the omelette was ok its hard to mess up eggs but there was nothing special about it the donut holes are mainly air and deflate immediately upon first contact with teeth perhaps its personal preference but i prefer my donuts fluffy and full of flour the waitress knew the service was bad and brought us a free bottle of champagne to try and make up for it sadly wycliff just doesnt make up for awful service we also never saw her again after that until we asked for the check they did have cholula hot sauce available which was a win however unless youre desperate for food i recommend trying another spot for brunch
